<div><h1 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Chapter I</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Geraint pulled his black cowl forward
over his head, and stepped out into the porch.
Some one thrust the door to behind him, and there
was the sound of an oak bar being dropped into the slots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A full moon stared at Brother Geraint over the top of
a thorn hedge. He stood there for a while in the deep
shadow, licking his lips, and listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere down the valley a dog was baying the moon,
a little trickle of discord running through the supreme
silence of the night. Brother Geraint tucked his hands
into his sleeves, grinned at the moon, and started down
the path with his shadow following at his heels. He loitered
a moment at the gate, glancing back over his shoulder at
the house that blinked never a light at him, but stood
solid and black and silent in the thick of a smother of
apple trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man at the gate nodded his head gloatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace be with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a self-pleased, triumphant snuffle, swung the
gate open, glanced up and down the path that crossed the
meadows, and then turned homewards through the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Orchard Valley the dew lay like silver samite on the
grass, and the boughs of the apple trees were white as
snow. Between the willows the Rondel river ran toward
the sea, sleek and still and glassy, save where it thundered
over the weir beside the prior’s mill. The bell-tower of
Paradise cut the northern sky into two steel-bright halves.
Over yonder beyond the river the Forest held up a cloak
of mystery across the west. Its great beech trees were
glimmering into green splendor and lifting a thousand
crowded domes against the brilliance of the moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Geraint had no care for any of these things.
He swung along toward Paradise like a dog returning from
an adventure, his fat chin showing white under his cowl,
his arms folded across his chest. The cluster of hovels and
cottages that stretched between the river and the priory
gate was discreetly dark and silent, with no Peeping Tom
to watch the devout figure moving between the hedges
and under the orchard trees. Paradise slept peacefully in
its valley, and left the ordering of things spiritual to
St. Benedict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priory, lying there in the midst of the smooth
meadows, looked white and chaste and very beautiful. The
night was so still that even the aspen trees that sheltered
it on the north would not have fluttered their leaves had
the month been June. The gold weathercock at the top of
the flèche glittered in the moonlight. The bell-tower, with
its four pinnacles, seemed up among the stars. Sanctity,
calm, devout splendor! And yet the gargoyles ranged below
the battlements of the gate opened their black mouths
with a suggestion of obscene and gloating laughter. It was
as though they hailed Brother Geraint as a boon comrade,
a human hungry creature with wanton eyes and scoffing
lips:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, you sly sinner! Hallo, you dog!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The black holes in the stone masks up above mouthed
at him in silent exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Geraint did not make his entry by the great
gate. There was a door in the precinct wall that opened
into the kitchen court, and this door served. The monk
passed along the slope under the infirmary, and so into the
cloisters. He had taken off his shoes, and went noiselessly
on his stockinged feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he paused like a big, black, listening bird, his
head on one side. For some one was chanting in the priory
church. Geraint knew the voice, and his teeth showed in
the dark slit of his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brre—pious bastard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hate gleamed under his black cowl. He crept noiselessly
up the steps that led to the doorway, and along the
transept, and craning his head around the pillar of the
chancel arch, looked up into the choir. The great window
was lit by the moon, its tracery dead black in a sheet of
silver. The light shone on the lower half of Brother
Geraint’s face, but his eyes were in the shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man was kneeling in one of the choir stalls, a young
man with his hood turned back and his hair shining like
golden wire. He knelt very straight and erect, his head
thrown back, his arms folded over his chest. He had ceased
his chanting, and his eyes seemed to be looking at something
a long way off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a grotesque and ferocious sneer on Brother
Geraint’s face. Then his lips moved silently. He was
speaking to his own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How bold the whelp is before God! A bladder of lard
hung up in a shop could not look more innocent. Innocent!
Damnation! This bit of green pork needs curing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded his head significantly at the man in the choir,
and crept back out of the church. In going from the
cloisters toward the prior’s house he met a little old fellow
carrying a leather bottle, and walking with his head thrust
forward as though he were in a hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s speed, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood close together under the wall, leering at each
other in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the prior abed yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man held up the bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just been filling his jack for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Empty, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint took the bottle and drank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burgundy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He licked his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ale is all very well, Holt, but a stomachful of this red
stuff is good after a night of prayer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man sniggered, and nodded his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Warms up the blood again. Ssst—listen to that young
dog yelping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could hear Brother Martin chanting in the choir.
Geraint’s hand shot out and gripped the cellarer’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly you love him, friend Holt. Why, the young
man is a saint; he brings us glory and reputation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stuffed glory and geese!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holt mouthed and jiggered like an angry ape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a bad day for us when old Valliant renounced
the devil and dedicated his bastard to God. Why, the
young hound is getting too big for his kennel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even preaches against the leather jack, my friend!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, more than that. Sniffing at older men’s heels,
hunting them when they go a-hunting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll find a cure for that. He shall be one of us before
Abbot Hilary comes poking his holy nose into Paradise.
Why, the young fool is green as grass, but there must be
some of old Valliant’s blood in him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blood of Simon Zelotes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see, Holt; we shall see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prior’s parlor was a noble room carried upon arches,
its three windows looking out on the prior’s garden and
the fruit trees of the orchard. A roofed staircase, the roof
carried by carved stone balustrades, led up to the vestibule.
Geraint, still carrying his shoes, went up the stairway with
the briskness of a man who did not vex his soul with
ceremonious deliberations. Nor did he trouble to rap on
the prior’s door, but thrust it open and walked in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old man was sitting in an oak chair before the fire,
his paunch making a very visible outline, his feet cocked
up so that their soles caught the blaze. His lower lip hung
querulously. His bold, high forehead glistened in the fire-light,
and his rather protuberant blue eyes had a bemused,
dull look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned, glanced at Brother Geraint, and grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you are not abed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am here—as you see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut the door, brother. What a man it is for draughts
and windy adventures!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint closed the door, and throwing back his cowl,
pulled a stool up to the fire. He was a lusty, lean, big-jawed
creature, as unlike Prior Globulus as an eagle is
unlike a fat farmyard cock. His eyes were restless and very
shrewd. The backs of his hands were covered with black
hair, and one guessed that his chest was like the chest of
an ape. He had a trick of moistening his lower lip with his
tongue, a big red lip that jutted out like the spout of a jug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is passing cold, sir, when a man has to walk without
his shoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust his gray-stockinged feet close to the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You observe, sir, I am a careful man. Our young house-dog
is awake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched Prior Globulus with shrewd, sidelong attention;
but the old man lay inert in his chair and blinked
at the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Martin is very careful for our reputation, sir.
He has become the thorn in our mortal flesh. It is notorious
that he eschews wine, fasts like a saint, and has no eyes or
ears for anything that is carnal—save, sir, when he discovers
such frailties in others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prior turned on Geraint with peevish impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pest on the fellow; he is no more than a vexatious
fool. Let him be, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint leaned forward and spread his hands before the
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Martin is no fool, sir; I am beginning to believe
that the fellow is very sly. He watches and says but
little, yet there is a something in those eyes of his. He
lives like a fanatic, while we, sir, are but mortal men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled and rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you know, sir, it was mooted that Abbot Hilary
has his eyes on Paradise. Some one whispered shame of
us, and Abbot Hilary is the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prior Globulus sat up straight in his chair, his face
full of querulous anger and dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foul lies, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foul lies, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint’s voice was ironical. His eyes met the older
man’s, and Prior Globulus could not meet the look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” and he grinned peevishly. “What does
your wisdom say, my brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint edged his stool a little closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Martin must be taught to be mortal,” he
said; “he must become one of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how shall that befall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you, sir. Is not the fellow old Valliant’s
son—old Valliant whose blood was like Spanish wine?
Brother Martin is a young man, and the spring is
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked together for a long while before the fire,
their heads almost touching, their eyes watching the
flames playing in the throat of the chimney.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter II</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>White mist filled the valley, for there was
no wind moving, and the night had been
very still. The moon had sunk into the Forest,
but though the sun had not yet climbed over the
edge of the day a faint yellow radiance showed in the
east. As for the birds, they had begun their piping, and
the whole valley was filled with a mysterious exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into this world of white mist and of song walked
Brother Martin, old Roger Valliant’s son—old Valliant,
the soldier of fortune who had fought for pay under all
manner of kings and captains, and had come back to take
his peace in England with an iron box full of silver and
gold. Old Valliant was dead, with the flavor of sundry
rude romances still clinging to his memory, for even
when his hair was gray he had caught the eyes of the
women. Then in his later years a sudden devoutness had
fallen upon him; there had been a toddling boy in his
house and no mother to care for the child. Old Valliant
had made great efforts to escape the devil; that was what
his neighbors had said of him. At all events, he had left
the child and his money to the monks of Paradise, and
had made a most comely and tranquil end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Martin was three-and-twenty, and the tallest
man in Orchard Valley. The women whispered that it
was a pity that such a man should be a monk and take
his state so seriously. There was a tinge of red in his
hair; his blue eyes looked at life with a bold mildness;
men said that he was built more finely than his father,
and old Valliant had been a mighty man-at-arms. Yet
Brother Martin often had the look of a dreamer, though
his flesh was so rich and admirable in its youth. He loved
the forest, he loved the soft meadows and the orchards,
the path beside the river where the willows trailed their
branches in the water, his stall in the choir, the mill
where the wheel thundered. The children could not let
him be when he walked through the village. As for the
white pigeons in the priory dovecot, they would perch
on his hands and shoulders. And yet there was a mild
severity about the man, a clear-sighted and unfoolish
chastity that brooked no meanness. He was awake even
though he could dream. He had had his wrestling matches
with the devil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Martin went down to the river that May
morning, stripped himself, piled his clothes on the trunk
of a fallen pollard willow, and took his swim. He let
himself drift within ten yards of the weir, and then struck
back against the swiftly gliding water. There had been
heavy rains on the Forest ridge, and the Rondel was
running fast—so fast that Martin had to fight hard to
make headway against the stream. The youth in him
had challenged the river; it was a favorite trick of his
to let himself be carried close to the weir and then to
fight back against the suck of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a woman was watching him. She had been standing
all the while under a willow, leaning her body against
the trunk of the tree, her gray cloak and hood part of
the grayness of the dawn. Nothing could be seen of her
face save the white curve of her chin. She kept absolutely
still, so still that Martin did not notice her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rondel river gave Martin a fair fight that morning.
All his litheness and his strength were needed in
the tussle; he conquered the river by inches, and drew
away very slowly from the thundering weir. The woman
hidden behind the willow leaned forward and watched
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had risen, a great yellow circle, when Martin
reached the spot where he had left his clothes. The
mist was rising, and long yellow slants of light struck
the water and lined the scalloped ripples with gold. The
water was very black under the near bank, and as Martin
climbed out, holding to the trailing branches of a willow,
he saw the dew-wet meadows shining like a sheet
of silver. The birds were still exulting. The sunlight struck
his dripping body and made it gleam like the body of a
god.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had frocked himself and was knotting his
girdle when he heard the woman speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mother Mary, but I thought death had you!”
She threw herself on her knees and seized one of his
hands in both of hers. “The saints be thanked, holy
father; but we in Paradise would be wrath with you
for thinking so little of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stared at her, and in his astonishment he suffered
her to keep a hold upon his hand. Her hood had
fallen back, and showed her ripe, audacious face, and her
black-brown eyes that were full of a seeming innocence.
Her hair was the color of polished bronze, and her teeth
very white behind her soft, red lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here, child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was austere, yet gentle, and strangely unembarrassed.
The girl was a ward of Widow Greensleeve’s, of
Cherry Acre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a show of confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was out to gather herbs, holy father—herbs that
must have the dew on them—and I saw you struggling
in the river—and was afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled at her, and withdrew his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you for your fear, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, you are so well loved in the valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood up, smoothing her gown, and looking shyly
at the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not angry with me, Father Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I be angry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In truth, but my fear for you ran away with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a quick and eloquent flash of the eyes,
and turned to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must gather my herbs, holy father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace be with you,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went on his way, as though nothing singular
had happened. The girl loitered under the willows, looking
back at him with mischievous curiosity. He was very
innocent, but somehow she liked him none the less for
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it is very pleasant to be so saintly,” she said;
“yet he is a fine figure of a man. I wonder how long it
will be before Father Satan comes stalking across the
meadows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate Succory made a pretense of searching for herbs,
so ordering her steps that she found herself on the path
that led to the house at Cherry Acre. The path ran between
high hawthorn hedges that sheltered the orchards,
and since the hedges were in green leaf, the way was like
a narrow winding alley between high walls. She did not
hurry herself, and presently she heard some one following
her along the path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morrow, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She halted and turned a mock-demure face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-morrow, holy father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint was grinning under his cowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are up betimes, sweeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked on with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been gathering herbs, and I have the cow to
milk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent maid. And nothing wonderful has happened
to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have fallen in love with some one,” she said
tartly; “it is a girl’s business to fall in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint sniggered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I commend such humanity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not with you, holy father. Do not flatter yourself
as to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tossed her head, and walked daintily, swinging
her shoulders. And Geraint looked at her brown neck,
and opened and shut his hairy hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps Dame Greensleeve will give me a cup of hot
milk?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, to be sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she began to whistle like a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Martin was a mile away, brushing his feet
through the dew of the upland meadows. He had crossed
the footbridge at the mill, and spoken a few words
with Gregory, the miller, who had thrust a shock of
sandy hair out of an upper window. Rising like a black
mound on the edge of the Forest purlieus stood a grove
of yews, and it was toward these yews that Martin’s footsteps
tended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yews were very ancient, with huge red-black trunks
and dense green spires crowded together against the
blue. No grass grew under them, for the great trees
starved all other growth and cheated it of sunlight. A
path cut its way through the solemn gloom, but the yew
boughs met overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet there was life in the midst of this black wood,
life that was grotesque and piteous. The path broadened
to a spacious glade, and in the glade stood a little rude
stone house thatched with heather. The dwellers here
labored with their hands, for a great part of the glade
was cultivated, and about the house itself were borders
of herbs, roses, and flowering plants. A couple of goats
were browsing outside the wattle fence that closed in
the garden, and a blue pigeon strutted and cooed to its
mate on the roof ridge of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stopped at the swinging hurdle that served
as a gate. A man was hoeing between the rows of broad
beans, an old man to judge by the stoop of his shoulders
and the slow and careful way he used the hoe. He wore
a coarse white smock with a hood to it; a kind of linen
mask covered his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are working early, Master Christopher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man turned and straightened himself with curious
deliberation. There was something ghastly about that
white mask of his with its two black slits for eye-holes.
He looked more like a piece of mummery than a man,
a grotesque figure in some rustic play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted up a cracked voice and shouted:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Giles, Peter—Brother Martin is at the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two be-cowled and masked creatures came out of the
house. All three were so alike and so much of a size that
a stranger would not have told one from the other. They
formed themselves into a kind of procession, and shuffling
to the gate, knelt down on a patch of grass inside it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s voice was very gentle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I chant the Mass, brothers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three lepers looked at him like lost souls gazing
at Christ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lord be merciful to us and cast His blessing
upon you,” said one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin chanted the Mass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three bowed their heads before him, as though
it gave them joy to listen to the sound of his voice, for
Martin chanted like a priest and a soldier and a woman
all in one. He had no fear of these poor creatures, did
not shrink from them and hold aloof. When he brought
them the Sacrament he did not pass God’s body through
a hole in the wall. The birds had ceased their singing,
and the world was very still, and Martin’s voice went
up to heaven with a strong and valiant tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had ended the Mass the three lepers got up
off their knees and began to talk like children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you smell my gillyflowers, Brother Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The speckled hen has hatched out twelve chicks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should see what Peter has been making; three
maple cups all polished like glass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Lord keeps the frosts away there will be a
power of fruit on the trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin opened the gate and walked into the garden,
and the three followed him as though he had come
straight out of heaven. No other living soul ever came
nearer than the place where the path entered the yew
wood. Alms were left there, and such goods as the lepers
could buy. But Brother Martin had no fear of the horror
that had fallen on them, and had such a fear shown itself
he would have crushed it out of his heart. And so he had
to see and smell Christopher’s gillyflowers, handle the
speckled hen’s chicks, and admire the maple cups that
Peter had made. Nature was beautiful and clean even
though she had cast a foul blight upon these three poor
creatures. They hung upon Martin’s words, watched him
with a kind of timid devotion. God walked with them
in that lonely place when Brother Martin came from
Paradise and through the wood of yews.</p>

<hr class='tbk100'/>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Brother Geraint had followed Kate Succory
to Widow Greensleeve’s house in Cherry Acre,
where the maze of high hedges and orchard trees hid his
black frock completely. The girl had gone a-milking, and
Brother Geraint had certain things to say to the widow.
He sat on a settle in the kitchen, and she moved to and
fro before him, a big breeze of a woman, plump, voluble,
very rosy, with roguish eyes and an incipient double chin.
She laughed a great deal, nodded her head at him, and
snapped her fingers, for she and Brother Geraint understood
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate will dance to that tune. Bless me, she’ll need
no persuading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint spoke very solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she can cure the young man of his self-righteousness
she shall be well remembered by us all. See to it, dame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow curtsied, making a capacious lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your servant, holy father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she fell a-laughing in a sly, shrewd way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God be merciful to us, my friend; yet I do believe
that it is more pleasant to live with sinners than with
saints. The over-pious man rides the poor ass to death.
Now you—my friend——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed so that her bosom shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We would all confess to Brother Geraint. I know the
kind of penance that you would set me, good sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint got up and kissed her, and her brown eyes
challenged his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it to me,” she said; “I will physic the young
man for you.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter III</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had gone down the valley to watch the
woodmen felling oaks in the Prior’s Wood
when old Holt rode out on a mule in search
of him. He found Martin stripped like the men and
working with them, for he loved laboring with his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Martin—Brother Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Holt squeaked at him imperiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Martin, a word with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin passed the felling ax that he had been swinging
to one of the men, and crossed over to Father Holt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prior has been asking for you. Get you back
at once. Brother Jude has been taken sick, and is lying
in the infirmary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin glanced up at old Holt’s wrinkled, crab-apple
of a face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who has gone to the Black Moor in Jude’s place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not ride here to gossip, brother. See to it that
you make haste home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin let old Holt’s testiness fly over his shoulders,
and went and put on his black frock. The cellarer pushed
his mule deeper into the wood where the men were
barking one of the fallen trees, and Martin left him
there and started alone for Paradise. The great oaks
were just coming into leaf, the golden buds opening
against the blue of the sky. The young bracken fronds
were uncurling themselves from the brown tangle of last
year’s growth, and here and there masses of wild hyacinth
made pools of blue. The gorse had begun to burn with
a lessened splendor, but the broom had taken fire, and
waved its yellow torches everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin found Prior Globulus in his parlor, sitting by
a window with a book in his lap. The prior had been
dozing; his eyes looked misty and dull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have sent for me, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come you here, Brother Martin. Assuredly—I have
been asleep. Yes—I remember. Brother Jude has been
taken sick. He rode in two hours ago, with a sharp
fever. I have chosen you to take his place, my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dull eyes watched Martin’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chapel on the Black Moor must have a priest.
There are people, my son, who would not pardon us
if we left that altar unserved even for a day. Get you
a mule and ride there. To-morrow I will send two pack
mules with food and wine and new altar cloths and vestments.
No cell of ours shall be served in niggardly
fashion. And remember, my son, that it is part of our
trust to serve all wayfarers with bread and wine, should
they ask for bread and wine. Holy St. Florence so ordered
it before she died. And there is the little hostelry where
wayfarers may lodge themselves for the night. All these
matters will be in your keeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groped in a gypsire that lay on the window seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is the key of the chapel, Brother Martin. Now
speed you, and bear my blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin kissed the ring on the old man’s hand, and
went forth to take up his trust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Forest was the great lord of all those parts. From
Gawdy Town, by the sea, to Merlin Water it stretched
ten leagues or more, a green, rolling wilderness, very
mysterious and very beautiful. There were castles, little
towns and villages hidden in it, and a stranger might
never have known of them but for the sound of their
bells. In the north the Great Ridge bounded the Forest
like a huge vallum, and on one of the chalk hills stood
Troy Castle, its towers gray against the northern sky.
Gawdy Town, where the Rondel river reached the sea,
held itself in no small esteem. It was a free town, boasted
its own mayor and jurats, appointed its own port reeve,
sent out its own ships, and hoarded much rich merchandise
in its storehouses and cellars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day had an April waywardness when Martin
mounted his mule and set out for the Black Moor. Masses
of cloud moved across the sky, some of them trailing
rain showers from the edges, and letting in wet floods of
sunlight when they had passed. The Forest was just breaking
into leaf; the birch trees had clothed themselves; so
had the hazels; the beeches were greener than the oaks,
whose domes varied from yellow to bronze; the ash buds
were still black, promising a good season. The wild cherries
were in flower. The hollies glistened after the rain,
and the warm, wet smell of the earth was the smell of
spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not till Martin reached Heron Hill did the Forest
show itself to him in all its mystery. The Black Moor
hung like a thunder-cloud ahead of him, splashed to the
south with sunlight after the passing of a shower. He
could see the sea, covered with purple shadows and
patches of gold. Below him, and stretching for miles,
the wet green of the woods lost itself in a blue gray haze,
with the Rondel river a silver streak in the valleys. Here
and there a wood of yews or firs made a blackness in the
thick of the lighter foliage. Martin saw deer moving along
the edge of Mogry Heath. Larks were in the air, and the
green woodpecker laughed in the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was low in the west when the mule plodded
up the sandy track that led over the Black Moor. The
gorse had lost its freshness, but the yellow broom and
the white of the stunted thorns lightened the heavy
green of the heather. The chapelry stood on the top-most
swell of the moor, marked by a big oak wayside
cross, its heather-thatched roofs clustering close together
like sheep in a pen. There were a chapel, a priest’s cell,
a little guest-house, a stable, a small lodge or barn, and a
stack of fagots standing together in a grassy space. Father
Jude was a homely soul, a man of the soil; he had fought
with the sour soil, made a small garden, and hedged it
with thorns, though the apple trees that he had planted
were all blown one way and looked stunted and grotesque.
He had cut and stacked bracken for litter, and there was
a small haystack in the hollow over the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stabled the mule, carried his saddle-bags into
the cell, and took stock of his new home. He went first
to the little chapel, unlocked the door, and saw that the
holy vessels were safe in the aumbry beside the altar,
and that no one had been tampering with the iron-bound
alms-box that was fastened to the wall close to the
holy water stoup. The chapel pleased him with its stone
walls and the rough forest-hewn timber in its roof. He
knelt down in front of the altar and prayed that in his
lonely place he might not be found wanting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the mule to be watered and fed, and Martin
saw to the beast before he thought of his own supper.
Father Jude’s larder suggested to him that hunger was an
excellent necessity. He found a stale loaf of bread, a big
earthen jar full of salted meat, half a bowl of herrings, a
pot of honey, a paper of spices, and the remains of a
rabbit pie. Obviously Father Jude had been something
of a cook, and Martin stared reflectively at the brick
oven in the corner of the cell. Cooking was an art that
he had not studied, but on the top of the Black Moor
a man had a chance of completing a thoroughly practical
education. For instance, there was the question of
bread. How much yeast went to how much flour, and
how long had the loaves to be left in the oven? Martin
saw that life was full of housewifely problems. A man’s
body might be more importunate than his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had made a meal and washed his hollywood
cup and platter, he found that dusk was falling over the
Forest like a purple veil. The wayside cross spread its
black arms against a saffron afterglow. The world was
very peaceful and very still, and a heavy dew was falling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went and sat at the foot of the cross, leaning his
broad back against the massive post. His face grew dim
in the dusk, and a kind of a sadness descended on him.
There were times when a strange unrest stirred in him,
when he yearned for something—he knew not what. The
beauty of the earth, the wet scent of the woods, the
singing of birds filled him with a vague emotion that was
near to pain. It was like the spring stirring in his blood
while a wind still blew keenly out of the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin Valliant’s faith was very simple as yet,
and crowned with a tender severity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Devil goeth about cunningly to tempt men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts wandered back to Paradise, and set him
frowning. He was not so young as not to know that all
was not well with the world down yonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Lord was tempted in the wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared up at the stars, and then watched the yellow
face of the moon rise over Heron Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good for a man to be alone, to keep watch and
to know his own heart. God does nothing blindly. When
we are alone we are both very weak and very strong.
There are voices that speak in the wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt comforted, and a great calm descended on
him. Those taunting lights had died out of the western
sky; the beauty of the earth no longer looked slantwise
at him like a young girl whose eyes are tender and whose
breasts are the breasts of a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pallet bed in the cell had a mattress of sacking
filled with straw. It served Martin well enough. He slept
soundly and without dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at Paradise Geraint had gone a-prowling through
the orchards. He loitered outside Widow Greensleeve’s
gate till some one came out with smothered laughter and
spoke to him under the apple boughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pan is on the fire, dame. Brother Martin has
gone to the Black Moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the fat is ready for frying, my master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few pinches of spice—eh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a pretty dish fit for a king.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter IV</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A tall ship, the Rose, came footing it toward
Gawdy Town with a wash of foam at her bluff
bows, and the green seas lifting her poop. Gawdy
Town was very proud of the Rose, for she was fit to be a
king’s ship, and to carry an admiral’s flag if needs be.
Her towering poop and forecastle had their walls pierced
for guns, and their little turrets loopholed for archers,
and all her top gear was painted to match her name.
She carried three masts and a fine spread of canvas,
and Master Hamden, her captain, loved to come into
port with streamers flying and all the gilding of her
vanes and bulwarks shining like gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rose struck her canvas and dropped her tow ropes
when she was under the shelter of the high ground west
of the harbor. A couple of galleys came out to tow her
in, and she was berthed at the Great Wharf under the
walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She carried merchandise and wine from Spain and
Bordeaux, also a few passengers; but the passengers were
of small account. Two of them, a girl and a young man,
were leaning over the poop rail and watching the people
on the wharf below. The young man’s face was yellow
as a guinea; he was dressed like a strolling player, with
bunches of ribbons at his elbows and bells in his cap.
The girl looked the taller of the two, perhaps because the
sea had not humbled her; she wore a light blue coat
edged with fur, and a gown of apple green; her green
hood had white strings tied under her chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy saints, what an adventure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man straightened himself, and managed to smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew what cowardice was like till I got aboard
a ship. My courage came out of my mouth. And now
an impudent tongue and a laughing eye are necessities——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s dark eyes were on the alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s old Adam Rick, or am I blind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master Port Reeve—so it is! The bridge is ashore.
We had best be putting our fortune to the test. Have
I anything of the gay devil left about me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook himself with the air of a bird that had been
moping on a perch, but the girl did not laugh; she held
her head high, and seemed to take life with fierce seriousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed down to the waist of the ship where
Master Hamden stood by the gangway, talking to some
of the fathers of Gawdy Town who were gathered on
the wharf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“News, sirs, what would you with news? If Crookback
is still king, I have no news for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There have been rumors of landings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rumors of old wives’ petticoats!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man and the girl were close at his elbow, ready
to leave the ship. The man carried a leather-covered
casket in one hand, and a viol under his arm, while the
girl carried a lute. She kept her eyes fixed on the tower
of the town church; they were very dark eyes, blue almost
to blackness, her skin was softly browned like the
skin of a Frenchwoman, but her lips were very red.
The hair under her hood was the color of charcoal. Her
attitude toward her neighbors seemed one of aloofness;
men might have voted her a proud, fierce-tempered
wench.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Hamden looked at the pair with his red-lidded,
angry eyes. The man nodded to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day, master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give you good-day, Jack Jester. Go and get some wine
in you, and wash the yellow out of your skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked slantwise at the girl as she passed him, but
he did not speak to her. Had she been all that she pretended
to be she would not have left old Hamden’s
ship without a coarse jest of some kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother was pushing his way toward a handsome,
ruddy man in a black camlet cloak, and the man in the
cloak was eying him intently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Adam, a word with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Port Reeve appeared lost in thought. He drew
a quill from his girdle, and meditated while he picked
his teeth. And very much at his leisure, he chose to
notice the young man with the viol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you come from, my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“France, sir. My sister and I are poor players, makers
of music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Port Reeve scanned the pair with intelligent brown
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer that such a Jack and Jill should come out
of France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were in the service of my Lord of Dunster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he sent you packing? How are you called?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man answered in a low voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lambert Lovel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Port Reeve’s eyelids flickered curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would lodge in Gawdy Town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it pleases you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our laws are strict against vagabonds and strollers.
Well, get you in, Lovel, my lad, and your sister with you.
You make no tarrying, I gather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But to make a little money for the road, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, try the ‘Painted Lady,’ my man. It is the
merchants’ tavern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave them something very like a solemn wink, and
then turned aside to talk to a sea-captain who wanted
to quarrel about the port dues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strolling singers entered Gawdy Town by the sea-gate,
and chose a winding street that went up toward
the castle. Lambert carried himself with a jaunty and
half-insolent air, fluttering his ribbons and making grimaces
at the people in the doorways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember your name, sweeting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I a fool, Gilbert!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God save us,” and he glanced at her impatiently,
“but you have forgotten mine! Lambert Lovel, brother
to Kate Lovel. Be wary; the Crookback has spies in every
port.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why stay in the town—at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you wild falcon! Are there not things to be done
here? Are we not hungry? Besides, the Forest is seven
miles away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know—but it is home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother laughed. He was built on lighter, gayer
lines than the girl; he had not her strength. A sort of
adventurous vanity carried him along, and life pleased
him when it was not too grim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robin, sweet Robin under the greenwood tree! A
pile of stones and a few burnt beams! Scramble, you
brats—scramble!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a lordly air he pretended to throw money to
a number of children who seemed inclined to follow
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have to play your part, sweeting. Where
the devil is that gaudy inn? Ha! we have it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A broad square paved with cobbles opened in front
of them, its timber and plaster houses built out on
brackets and pillars, many of them carrying painted signs
hung out on poles. A stone cross stood in the center of
the square, and above the lichened roof of the town hall
the great round tower of the castle showed like a crown
resting on a cushion. The “Inn of the Painted Lady”
stood by the guild house of the Armourers’ Guild, a
noisy, buxom, deep-chested house, its plaster-work painted
green and red, its sign looking like a Roman mosaic.
A white mule and a couple of palfreys were waiting outside
the entry, and from an open window came the sound
of some one singing:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Cuckolds, cuckolds, list to my tale——”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>It was a big, brawling voice that sang, the voice of
a man who was hearty with liquor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lovel looked at the place a little doubtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fat—and bountiful! I will go and beard my friend—the
host.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl turned aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be there—on the steps of the cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be brave, sweeting.” And he went off humming a song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reappeared shortly with a certain whimsical look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be suffered to sleep with the sluts, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the scullions! What men must stomach for the
sake of—adventure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her nostrils dilated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Forest would be sweeter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, dear sister; but shall we be frightened by having
to sleep on musty straw with fellow Christians who
wash under the pump but once a week? I trust not.
Besides, I have to see the Flemming to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her pride was in revolt, the pride of a kestrel put to
perch with flea-ridden hens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had I known this I would have chosen to cross the
sea in some other dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother shrugged his shoulders, and then sat down
beside her on the stone steps of the cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, Kate, but what would you? We have begun
this game in cap and bells, and we must go through
with it—or pay forfeit. And the forfeit may be our lives.
Crooked Dick shows no mercy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right, and she knew it. There could be no
turning back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What must be—must be. I shall not fail you, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s brave; but one word more, Kate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your pride may be sorely touched in yonder, for you
are a singing-girl, no more, no less. Take it not to heart,
child, and do not let it anger you. I would stab the
man who offered to do you harm, even though the
dagger blow meant ruin for both of us. I, too, have my
pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those are a man’s words. You shall not be disappointed
in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later Mellis Dale stood at an attic window
overlooking the inn yard. She had liked the part she
was playing still less when she had seen the attic, but
for the moment it was empty; the wenches who were
to be her bed-fellows were at their work below. She could
see her brother Gilbert sitting on an overturned tub in
the yard, twanging the strings of his viol, and making
the ostlers and loiterers laugh with his whimsies. His
color had come back to him; he was playing a man’s game,
even though it brought his feet very close to the gutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught some of her brother’s spirit, some of his
cynical and gay audacity. After all, they were not the
sport of fools, but players who made the fools dance to
their piping. Her pride caught a note of mockery. There
were enemies to be outwitted; there was the thought of
revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inn simmered with life like a kettle about to boil.
She could feel the bubbling of its activities, the reverberations
of its crude, animal energy. There was much
clattering of pots and pans, and much loud talking in
the kitchen. She could hear girls giggling, and a woman
scolding somewhere with a voice that suggested the rending
of linen. The gentleman with the big, brawling bass
was still singing in the deeps of the house, and other
voices took up the chorus. A knife-grinder appeared with
his barrow and wheel and started to sharpen knives. Two
dogs fell to fighting over a sheep’s foot that had been
flung out of the kitchen. A man rolled out from the
guest-room and was sick in the kennel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis saw her brother draw his bow from its case,
and begin playing his viol, and the music brought six
bouncing girls from somewhere, all ready to dance. They
footed it up and down the yard, holding up their gowns,
and laughing to each other, while the men stood around
and made jests. The windows of the inn filled with
faces; all sorts of unsuspected folk poked out their heads
to watch the fun. This living picture-show included a
little old lawyer, blue and wrinkled, with a dewdrop
hanging at the end of his nose; a red-faced widow with
a headdress like a steeple; a couple of priests; a vintner
from London who munched something as though he were
chewing the cud; a country squire with the eyes of an
ox; a young bachelor who kept looking up at Mellis
and showing off his slashed doublet and the jewel in his
ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The members of one of the Merchant Guilds were
supping together in the great guest-room, and servants
began to go to and fro across the yard with dishes
from the kitchen. Mellis saw a big man with a face as
round and as sallow as a cream cheese come out and
speak to her brother. Gilbert glanced up at her, and then
beckoned her to come down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She appeared in the yard, with her lute hanging from
her shoulders by a cherry-colored ribbon. The man with
the sallow face stared her over, and nodded his approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If her voice prove as good as her face, my guests will
have no cause to grumble. I will hire the two of you
for the evening, for a silver groat and your suppers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had to suffer the insolence of the fat fellow’s
eye. Her brother grimaced, and shook an empty gypsire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall not die of a surfeit of wealth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it or leave it,” said the innkeeper roughly. “I
have my choice of all the wastrels and wenches in Gawdy
Town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis’s face showed white and cold. The beast’s churlishness
roused such scorn in her that she soared above
such a thing as anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so for two hours she stood in the guest-room of
the “Painted Lady,” making music for men who over-ate
and over-drank themselves, and who looked at her
as none of them would have looked at their neighbors’
daughters or wives. Her scorn filled her with a kind of
devilry. She sang to see what manner of swine these men
were; sang to them as though each had the soul of a
Dan Chaucer. And not a few of them grew very silent,
and sat and stared at her with a brutish wonder. An
oldish man sniveled and wept. Her brother Gilbert was
kept busy scraping at the strings of his viol, and all the
passage-ways were crowded with servants and scullions
who crowded to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was famous, Kate,” he said to her as he saw her
safe to the stairs, “I passed around the cap and drew
five pence out of the worthies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I would sooner have sung to lost souls in
Hell,” she answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the attic she stripped off her spencer and gown,
and lay down on one of the straw pallets in her shift.
Her bed-fellows came up anon, three rollicking girls
who smelt of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Said one of them:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That brother of thine is a pretty fellow. I warrant
I’d tramp to Jerusalem with such a brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They tittered, and squeaked like mice. Mellis sat up
and looked at them by the glimmer of the rushlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dears,” she said, “I am very weary. Let me sleep.
One may have to sing when one’s heart is heavy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she silenced them. They crept to bed as quietly
as birds going to roost.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter V</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Martin said matins to the sparrows
who had built their nests in the thatch of the
chapel, and having drunk a cup of spring water
and eaten a crust of bread, he set out early to try to
lose himself in the Forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For life on the Black Moor was not all that it had
seemed, and a young man, however devout and determined
he may be, cannot satisfy his soul with prayers
and the planting of seeds in a garden. Martin had entered
upon the life with methodical enthusiasm, tolled
the chapel bell at matins and vespers, swept out his cell,
set the little guest-house in order, and done to death all
the weeds in Father Jude’s garden. But a man must be
fed, and it was in a struggle with this prime necessity
that Martin suffered his first defeat. He started out cheerfully
to bake bread, but the Devil was in the business;
the oven was either too hot or too cold, and there were
mysteries about such a simple thing as dough that Martin
had not fathomed. He tore a great hole in his cassock
in climbing up the woodstack to throw down fagots,
and then discovered that he had no needle and
thread for the mending of the rent. These trivial domestic
humiliations were discouraging. He conceived a most
human hatred of salt meat, herrings, and the obstinate
and adhesive pulp that he produced in the place of
bread. Milk and eggs, fresh meat and honey! He was
carnally minded with regard to such simple desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, he was most abominably lonely—the more
so, perhaps, because he had not realized his own loneliness.
Paradise appeared to have melted into the dim distance;
there might have been a conspiracy against him;
Martin had not seen a human face since Prior Globulus
had sent a servant to fetch away the mule, on the plea
that the beast was needed. And Martin had taken the
loss of the mule most unkindly. It was a confession, but
he had found the beast good company; it had been alive;
it had needed food and drink; had given signs of friendship;
had been a warm, live thing that he could touch.
The birds were very well in their way; but he was not
necessary to them, and they were wild. He saw deer moving
in the distance, but they were no more than the
figures of beasts worked in thread upon a tapestry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This morning restlessness of his was a kind of impulsive
pilgrimage in quest of something that he lacked—a
flight from that part of himself that remained unsatisfied.
He went striding over the heather toward the beech
woods in the valley. They were very green, and soft, and
beautiful and had seemed mysteriously alive when seen
from the brow of the Black Moor, but even in the woods
some essential thing was lacking. The great trees stood
spaced at a distance, their branches rising from the huge
gray trunks. The greenness and the listening gloom went
on and on, promising him something that was never
seen, never discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than once he came on an open glade where
rabbits were feeding, and the little brown fellows went
off at a scamper, showing the whites of their tails. Martin
felt aggrieved, even like a child who wanted playmates.
He leaned against a beech tree and consoled himself
with asking ridiculous questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should the beasts fear man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet he would have welcomed fresh venison!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Lord Christ were here in my place, would not
all the wild things come to Him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His simple faith could provide him with only one
answer, and that was not flattering to his self-knowledge.
He had not climbed to that state of complete purity; he
was no St. Francis. Perhaps Original Sin was at the
bottom of everything. And yet he had always mastered
his own body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant passed some hours in the woods before
turning back across the heather of the Black Moor.
A hawk, poised against the blue, took no more notice of
him than if he had been a sheep, and for a while Martin
stood watching the bird of prey. The hawk went boldly
on with his hunting; he would have had no pity for a
poor fool of a priest who was spending his powers in trying
to contradict Nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A puzzled look came into Martin Valliant’s eyes as
he neared the chapelry. A little tuft of smoke was drifting
from the chimney of his cell, and he knew that he
had lit no sticks under the oven that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have sent a servant from Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quickened his steps, but saw no live thing moving
about the place. He looked into the stable, and found it
empty; but the garden hedge offered him his first surprise.
Certainly the thing that he saw was nothing but a
shirt spread on the hedge to dry, and looking as white
and clean as one of the big clouds overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own cell offered further mysteries. The oven door
stood open, and a couple of nicely browned loaves were
waiting to be taken out. A meat pasty that smelled very
fragrant had been left on the oven shelf. His cassock,
neatly mended, hung over the back of Father Jude’s oak
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin could make nothing of these mysteries. The
loaves and the pasty were real enough—so real that he
remembered the cup of water and the crust of bread
with which he had broken his fast soon after dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went and looked into the chapel and the guest-room,
but there was no one there, nor could he see anything
moving over the moor. The business puzzled him
completely. It was possible that a servant had been sent
from Paradise; but Paradise was three leagues away, and
Martin would have expected to find a horse or a mule in
the stable. Moreover it occurred to him that some one
must have looked into the oven not so very long ago,
lifted out the pasty, and put it on the shelf. The good
creature might be hiding somewhere, but what need was
there for such a game of hide-and-seek?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin returned to the cell, set the pasty on the table,
took the loaves out of the oven, and his platter and cup
from the shelf. Common sense suggested that the food
was meant to be eaten. He pulled the stool up to
the table, said grace, took the knife from the sheath
at his girdle, and thrust the point of it through the
pie-crust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he sat rigid, listening, the blade of his knife
still in the pie and his hand gripping the haft. Some
one was singing on the moor among the yellow gorse and
broom. The voice was a girl’s voice, gay and birdlike and
challenging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sat there with a face like a ghost’s, his heart
beating fast, his eyes staring through the open doorway.
For the voice seemed to speak to him of all that he had
sought in the Forest and had not found. It was youth
calling to youth in the spring of the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice grew fainter and fainter; it seemed to be
dying away over the moor. Martin Valliant’s eyes dilated,
his knees shook together. He started up, knocking over
the stool, and rushed out of the cell like a madman, his
eyes full of a fanatical fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice had ceased singing. He climbed to the place
where the wooden cross stood, and looked fiercely about
him. But he saw nothing, nothing but the gorse and
broom and heather. He went down among the green
gorse banks, searched, and found nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sweat stood on his forehead, and his heart was hammering
under his ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he crossed himself, fell on his knees, and prayed.
The first thing he did on reaching his cell was to take
the loaves and the cooked meat and throw them into
the fire under the oven.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter VI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When a man has done what he believes to be a
good deed he is flushed for a while with a
happy self-righteousness, and may forget the
struggle he had with his own soul. So it was with Martin
Valliant. He had no quarrel with himself or with his
loneliness for the rest of that day. He had won a victory;
he had been tempted of the Devil and had refused the
meats that the Devil had cooked for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange—this fear of the white body or the lips of a
woman, this naïve cowardice that dares not look into
Nature’s eyes. In it one beholds the despair of saints
who see no hope for man save in the crushing of the
body to save the soul. The few struggle toward a cold
triumph, maimed, but half human. With holy ferocity
they run about to persuade humanity that God is without
sex. Men may listen to them; the deserts become filled
with monks; Nature is flouted for a while. Then the
thing becomes no more than a rotten shell; men obey
their impulses but still wear their vows; cynicism and a
lewd hypocrisy are born; the great realities are glozed
over. Then comes the day when a more youthful and
noble generation wakes to the horror of such a superstition.
Gates are torn off their hinges; walls battered down;
the slime and the refuse exposed to the sunlight. The
new generation runs to the woods and the fields like a
flock of children released from some abominable pedantry.
They are no longer afraid. The world grows young and
beautiful again. There is no sin in the sunset, no shame
in the singing of birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant felt himself uplifted all that day; but
the old Pagan people had gathered out of the woods and
were lying hidden in the gorse and heather. There was
Pan with his pipes; there were girls and young men who
had danced in the Bacchic dances; Orpheus with his lute.
Even the pale Christ looked down with compassionate
eyes, the Great Lover who was human till the fanatics
covered His face with a veil of lies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evening came, and the birds began their singing down
in the beech woods under the hill. They sang their way
into Martin Valliant’s heart, made him hear again the
voice of the girl singing on the moor. A great restlessness
assailed him. He went forth and wandered under the
stars, but there was no healing for him in their cold
brightness. And that night he slept like a man in fear of
the dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again, it was the birds which troubled him. He woke
in the gray of the morning, to hear their faint orisons
filling the valley. He arose, went to the chapel, and was
long at his prayers. Moreover, he chose to fast that morning,
contenting himself with a cup of cold water before
he wandered out over the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet in spite of all his carefulness Martin Valliant was
not wholly his own master that morning. He made himself
go forward, but a part of his soul kept looking back.
There was a voice, too, that challenged him. “Of what
are you afraid? Why are you trying to escape? A monk is
a soldier. He should fight, and not hide himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This voice would not be silenced. It was like a scourge
striking him continually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back,” it said; “blind men are afraid of falling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he obeyed it, vaguely conscious of the nearness
of some new ordeal. He did not guess that the all-wise
Mater Mundi had him by the hand, that he was one of
her chosen children. She would try him with fire, teach
him to be great through the power of his own compassion,
so that his soul might burn more gloriously
when the purer flame touched it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant found the door of his cell standing
open, and from within came the sound of the snapping
of dry wood. A girl was kneeling by the oven, with a
fagot lying on the floor at her side, and she was busy
laying the fire for the baking of bread. She was dressed
in a gown of apple green, and from the collar thereof
her firm white neck curved to meet the bronze of her
hair. So intent was she on breaking up the fagot wood
and building her fire that she had not discovered the
man standing in the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life had never yet posed Martin with such a problem
as this. He stood and stared at the girl, wondering how
to begin the attack. Her back was turned toward him,
and the initiative was his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he became inspired. He would assume blindness,
deafness, refuse to recognize her existence. He
would not so much as speak to her, and behold! the
problem would solve itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate Succory turned sharply at the sound of a man’s
footsteps. Her lashes half hid her roguish brown eyes;
she held a hazel bough between her two hands; her green
gown, cut low at the throat, showed the upper curves
of her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw Martin Valliant take his Mass-book from the
shelf, sit down in the chair, and begin to read. He was
within two yards of her, but for all the notice he took of
her she might have been less than a shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched him for some moments and then went
calmly on with her work, breaking the sticks to pieces
and feeding the fire. Absolute silence reigned in the
cell, save for the sound of the snapping of wood and the
crackling of the flames in the oven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes remained fixed on his book, but he was
most acutely conscious of what was happening so close
to him. The situation had taken on a sudden, unforeseen
complexity. He felt himself growing hot about
the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the fire appeared to be burning to the girl’s
satisfaction. She rose, went to the larder, brought out the
things that she required, and set them on the table.
Then she turned up the sleeves of her gown, and her
arms showed white and shapely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s face was growing the color of fire. He tried
not to see the girl, to anchor his whole consciousness to
the square of parchment in front of him. The dilemma
shocked him. Was it possible that this creature in the
green gown took his silence to be consenting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile she went on calmly with her work, hardly
looking in his direction, her red lips parting now and
again in a smile. Martin raised his eyes very cautiously
and looked at her. The solid and comely reality of her
shape, her purposeful composure, appalled him. This
problem would have to be attacked somehow, desperately,
and without delay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s intuition forestalled his gathering effort
toward revolt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was foolish of you to burn those loaves yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her with sudden, frank astonishment, but
said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good food should not be wasted like that. Besides,
I had come all that way to see what a pair of hands might
do for you, Father Martin. No bread could have been
cleaner; I always wash before baking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was an amazing development! The girl was
actually scolding him, reproving him for being wasteful,
assuming control of the stores in his cupboard. He opened
his mouth to speak, but again she forestalled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Jude was a very careful soul. Rose Lorrimer
had no trouble with him; she wept her eyes out when he
had to go back to Paradise. She had just made him two
new shirts. And she did not mind the loneliness up here,
for Father Jude is an old man, and Rose has seen
forty——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant laid his Mass-book on the table. Kate
Succory was talking so calmly and so naturally that he
knew she was to be believed; yet here was a new and
astonishing phase of monastic life thrust upon him without
a moment’s warning. Martin was no innocent, though
he had led a sheltered life; he knew that there were monks
at Paradise who had broken their vows. But here was this
girl coming all the way from Paradise village and turning
up her sleeves to keep house for him as though she were
doing the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He floundered in the depths of his own simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who sent you here, child?” he asked her bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate’s brown eyes met his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just mounted the gray donkey and came. No one
could have bidden me sweep your hearth for you. Rose
Lorrimer was hearth-ward to Father Jude, and before
Father Jude Father Nicholas was here, and old Marjory
cared for him; but she was not old Marjory then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, and began to mold the dough into shape,
her arms all white with flour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rose took Father Jude’s sheets away with her, but if
we can come by some good linen I will soon have things
as they should be. Of course, if I do not please you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a quick, sidelong glance, her teeth showing
between her red lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had gone as white as the dough she was
kneading. His knees were trembling. He could not escape
from the knowledge of her green gown, her shining hair,
and the sleekness of her skin. And her voice was very
pleasant, with a sly lilt of playfulness and of youth in
its tones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gripped the arms of his chair and stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child—” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him the full, challenging frankness of her
brown eyes, and Martin knew that he could not pretend
that she was a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very lonely here,” she said, looking at her hands,
“and a man cannot do a woman’s work. Rose told me
that travelers passed no more than once a month. And—and
I——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed his chair back, and groped with one hand
for the cross that hung at his girdle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not good that you should be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her head droop a little. Her hands rested on
the table. He strove with himself, and went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thank you, my sister. What I bear must be
borne for the sake of the vows I have taken. When I
kneel in the chapel, you shall be in my prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the sly, provoking roguery had gone from her face.
She did not speak for a moment, did not move. Then
she lifted her head and looked at him, and her brown
eyes were like the eyes of an animal in pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not a bad woman, Father Martin, not evil at
heart. But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught her breath, and pressed her hands to her
breasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned suddenly and walked straight out of the cell
into the glare of the sunlight. And Martin Valliant stood
biting the sleeve of his frock, and thinking of the look
her brown eyes had given him.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter VII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Kate Succory went no farther than the nearest
cluster of gorse on the slope of the moor. She
threw herself face downwards on a patch of short,
sweet turf, where rabbits had been feeding, and plucked
at the grass with her fingers, twisting her body to and
fro with the lithe and supple movements of a restless
animal. Her hair came loose, and she shook it down upon
her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was rebellion in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a good man. Why should he not have what
other men crave for? And I love him. There is not a man
so tall and fine in all the Forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rested her elbows on the ground and her chin in
her two hands, and stared at the gorse bushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Geraint would not have hesitated. Pah! that black
rat! How the girls would laugh at me! I don’t care. Why
did God make him a priest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She frowned fiercely and bit at her lower lip, the elemental
passion in her refusing to be dominated by the
rules of the Church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a good man. No; I will not go away. Priestcraft is
all wrong. The Lollards say so; I could argue it out with
him. As if living down there in a priory made men good!
Bah! what nonsense! Father Geraint is a black villain,
and the rest of them are not much better. I wonder if
he knows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A note of tenderness sounded in the turmoil of her
brooding. She smiled and caressed the grass, stroking it
with her open hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it would hurt him if he knew. And he was
as frightened of me as though I had walked naked into
the cell! Oh, my heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had been praying, little guessing that
the days would come when he would trust to his own
heart, and not be forever falling on his knees and asking
strength from God. He had thrown Kate’s unbaked loaves
into the fire, and made a meal from the scraps he had
found in the cupboard. But he was in no mood to sit
still and think. Father Jude’s spade offered itself as an
honest companion, and Martin went forth into the garden
to dig.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not turned two spadefuls of soil when Kate
Succory began singing. She was sitting hidden by the
gorse, her arms hugging her knees, and her voice had no
note of wayward exultation. It was as though she sang
to herself plaintively, like a bird bewailing its lost mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin frowned, and stood listening, but her singing
did not die away into the distance as he had expected.
She was hidden somewhere, and her voice remained to
trouble him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to dig with fierce determination, jaw set, eyes
staring at the brown soil. And presently he stopped, and
lifted up his head like a rabbit that has crouched hidden
in a tuft of grass. What a chance for a jester to have thrown
a clod at him! The girl’s singing had ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin breathed hard, and lifted up his spade for a
stroke, but the silence had fooled him.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The springtime into my blood.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>She gave the words with a kind of passionate recklessness,
and all her youth seemed to thrill in her throat.
Martin bowed his head and went on digging as though
by sheer physical effort he could save himself from being
a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently he found himself up against the hedge, with
no more ground that he could attack with the spade. The
hedge was in leaf, and hid the open moor from him. He
fancied he heard some one moving on the other side of
the green wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started to walk toward the chapel, but the voice
followed him along the hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be angry with me, Martin Valliant; I want
to speak with you. You are a good man and to be trusted;
I am a grown woman and no fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you say to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many things. I have the wit to know that all is not
well with the world. We are heretics, Father Martin,
heretics in our hearts. We—in Paradise—no longer believe
what the monks teach us, for they are bad men, who
laugh in their sleeves at God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such words should not come from your lips, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed recklessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak of what I see. Is Father Geraint a holy man?
Do the brothers keep their vows? And why should they—when
they are but men? It is all a great mockery. And why
did they send you away to this solitary place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer her at once, and his face was sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it is no mockery,” he said at last, “nor is life easy
for those who strive toward holiness. Get you gone, Kate.
I will keep my faith with God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could hear her plucking at the hedge with her
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not please you,” she said sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forgive you,” he answered her. “You are to me
but a brown bird or a child. Shall I offend against God,
and you, and my own soul because other men are base?
No; and I will prove my faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard him go to the cell, and a sudden awe of
him awoke in her heart. She went and hid in the gorse
and waited, expecting some strange and violent thing to
happen. Presently she saw him come forth carrying an
oak stool, a length of rope, and a knife. He went straight
toward the great wooden cross on its mound, and for a
moment panic seized her. Martin Valliant was going to
hang himself!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crouched, watching him, ready to rush out and
strive with him for his life. She saw Martin set the oak
stool at the foot of the cross, stand on it, cut the rope
into two pieces, and fasten them to the two arms of the
cross. He made a loop of each, and turning his back to
the beam, thrust his hands through the loops. Then she
understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had only to thrust the stool away or
take his feet from it, and he would hang by the arms—crucified.
And that was what he did. He raised himself
by drawing on the ropes, lifted his feet from the oak
stool, and let himself drop so that he hung by the arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate knelt there, her arms folded across her bosom.
Her brown eyes had grown big and solemn, more like
the eyes of a child. She looked at Martin Valliant, and
her awe of him was mingled with a strange, choking
tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long would he hang there? How long would he
endure? He had only to place his feet upon the oak stool
in order to rest himself to show some mercy to his body.
But the soul of the man welcomed pain. His eyes looked
steadily toward the sea with an obstinate tranquillity that
made her marvel at his patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was far spent and the sun low in the west, and
as the sun sank lower it fell behind the cross and showed
like a halo about Martin Valliant’s head. The glare was
in Kate’s eyes, so that the cross and the man hanging
upon it were no more than a black outline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long would he endure? How would it end?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, of a sudden, the eyes of her soul were
opened. She was no longer the laughing wench in love
with the shape of a man. She saw something noble hanging
there against the sunset, a figure that was like the
figure of the Christ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung herself on her face, and wept for Martin and
her own heart. There was no escape from the truth. It
was she who had crucified him, put him to this torment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had touched the hills and there was a wonderful
golden radiance covering the earth as she rose up with
wet eyes, and hastened toward the cross. She went on
her knees, kissed the man’s feet, and wiped away the
mark of her kisses with her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go,” she said, bowing her head. “If I have
sinned against your holiness, Martin Valliant, forgive me—because
I love you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at her and smiled, though his arms
felt as though they were being torn from their sockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who am I that I should forgive you, sister? Sometimes
it is good to suffer. Go back to Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose up and left him, running wildly down the
long slope of the moor, not daring to let herself look back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shall suffer no more for my sake,” she kept saying
to herself, and all the while she was weeping and wishing
herself dead.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter VIII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland, my Lord of Troy, rode back from
hunting in the Forest. Dan Love, his huntsman,
had sent word that morning that he had found the
slot of a hart down by Darvel’s Holt, and that the beast
lay close in one of the thickets. My Lord of Troy had
gone out with his hounds and gentlemen, hunted the
hart, and slain him. He was riding home in the cool of the
evening, the sunlight shining on his doublet of green
cloth of gold, its slashed sleeves puffed with crimson, as
though striped with blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Troy Castle loomed up above at the top of a steep and
grassy hill, throwing a huge shadow across the valley. It
was the crown of Roger Bland’s pride, the sign and
symbol of his greatness, for the Lord of Troy was a new
man, a shrewd hound who had lapped up the blood of
the old nobles butchered in the wars of Lancaster and
York. Richard Crookback had been well served by Roger
Bland. The fellow was a brain, an ear, a creature of the
closet, bold in betraying, cautious in risking his own soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the Lord of Troy had a presence, a certain lean
dignity. His face narrowed to a long, outjutting chin. His
mouth was very small, his pale eyes set somewhat close
together. The man’s nostrils were cruel, his forehead high
and serene. When he spoke it was with a dry and playful
shrewdness; he could be very debonair; his tongue wore
silk; there was nothing of the butcher about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland was a man of the new age, half merchant,
half scholar, with some of the pride of a prince. He had
caught the spirit of the Italians. Subtlety pleased him;
he despised the stupid English bull. And up in Troy
Castle he lived magnificently, and kept a quiet eye on the
country for leagues around, a hawk ready to pounce on
any stir or trouble in the land. And the Forest hated him
with an exceeding bitter hatred, for it had suffered grimly
at his hands, seeing that it had chosen to wear the Red
Rose when the White had proved more fortunate. The
Lord of Troy had ridden into it, and left great silences
behind him. There were houses empty and ruinous, and
no man dared go near them. There were people who had
fled across the sea. There were graves in the Forest,
shallow holes in the earth into which bodies had been
tumbled and left hidden in the green glooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Roger Bland’s black horse lifted him out of the
valley a man came down to meet him along the steep
road that climbed the hill. It was Noble Vance, the
Forest Warden, a thick, coarse stub of a man who dressed
to his own red color. The Forest folk feared him, and
mocked at his parents who had christened him so sententiously.
“Noble, forsooth!” He wore a doublet of scarlet
and hose of green. His red hat looked as big as the wheel
of a cart, and the face under it was the color of raw meat,
and all black about the jowl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swept his hat to the Lord of Troy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord has had good sport,” and he nodded toward
the hart lying across the back of a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent, Master Vance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is other game, my lord, beyond the purlieus. I
have ridden over to speak to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland glanced back over either shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good gossip, my friend——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you say, sir, a good gossip——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is best kept for the closet, and a cup of wine. Ride
here beside me. Yes, we have made an excellent day of
it; we turned that beast out by Darvel’s Holt and ran
him three miles. I love a beast with a good heart, Vance,
and a man who fights to the death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Forest Warden grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such men are growing scarce, my lord, in these parts.
A few green youngsters perhaps, and an old badger or
two deep down in their earths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like old Jack Falconer, I shall draw that badger some
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trumpets sounded as they crossed the bridge over the
dry moat, for my Lord of Troy had a love of ceremony and
spacious, opulent magnificence. The guards at the gate-house
presented their pikes. In the main court grooms
and servants came hurrying in my lord’s livery of silver
and green. A page stood uncovered beside Roger Bland’s
horse, with a cup of wine ready on a silver salver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My lord waved him aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring two cups, child, to my closet, and let it be
known that I am not to be troubled. Now, Master
Vance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered by a little door in an angle of the courtyard,
and a staircase led them to the great solar above and
at the end of the hall. From the solar a passage cut in
the thickness of the wall linked up my lord’s state chamber
with his closet in one of the towers. It was a richly
garnished room, its hangings of cloth of gold, its floor
covered with skins and velvets. There were books on the
table. The open door of a great oak armoire showed ivory
chessmen set ready on a board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My lord chose one of the window-seats. He liked a
stately perch, a noble view, and his back to the light.
The subtler shades did not matter to Noble Vance; he
let fate hang him where it pleased, like a joint of meat
in a butcher’s shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is wondrous hot for May, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blood is hot in the spring, Vance. Here comes
the wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page served them, and had his orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay in the gallery, Walter, and see that we are not
disturbed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Forest Warden waited for my lord to raise his cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your good esteem, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you hold it, Vance. Do things ever happen in
the Forest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But little, sir. You have left no man fit to quarrel
with you. But I have come upon a little business in
Gawdy Town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such places breed fleas—and adventures. What is it,
Vance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young Gilbert Dale and the girl are there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—those cubs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They came in the ship Rose. The lad is a grown man,
and the girl a fine, black-browed wench. Pimp Odgers
spied them out, though they played the part of strollers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have Odgers here, and another fellow who knew the
Dales, and could swear to the son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland turned in his seat and looked out over
the Forest. It was as noble a view as a man could desire,
a world of green valleys and distant hills blue on the
horizon. The lord of Troy Castle smiled as he sat there
high up in the tower, a sly, cynical smile of self-congratulation.
The Forest lay at his feet; he was its master. Even
the thought of the cruel strength he had shown in taming
it pleased him, for, like many men who lack brute physical
courage, he was cleverly and shrewdly cruel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many years, Vance, is it since that day when we
smoked the Dales out of Woodmere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven, this June, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Dale had sent his cubs away. What is the young
gadfly doing in Gawdy Town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Playing the viol and singing songs, with bells in his
cap. He goes out of nights, I hear, but my men say that
it is to Petticoat Lane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many things are hatched in a brothel, Vance. And
the girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plays the lute and sings. A haughty young madam,
they say, with eyes quick to stab a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no whisper of secret work, no playing for
Harry Richmond?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vance shook his big head solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I keep my nose for that fox,” he said, “but have struck
no scent as yet. What is your pleasure, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord of Troy continued to gaze out over the
Forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saw you ever anything more peaceful, Master Vance,
than yon green country? It is I who have taught it to be
peaceful, and much labor it gave me. I have cleared it of
wolves; I have cowed its broken men. I choose that it
shall remain at peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warden’s eyes glittered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Dales were ever turbulent, hot-blooded folk. That
young man might give us trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prevent it, Master Warden. You have a way of contriving
these things. A quarrel in some low house, daggers,
and a scuffle in the street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, it is as simple as eating pie. My men will
manage it. And the girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring her here, Master Vance. We will question her.
It is possible to learn things from a woman. Moreover,
our good king loves a wildfire jade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Forest Warden finished his wine, and wiped his
mouth with his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the rope that hanged Judas, sir,” he said, “it is a
pleasure to serve a great man who knows his own mind!”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter IX</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis and her brother had left Gawdy Town
lying behind them on the blue edge of the sea.
The day was very young, and a north wind came
over the marshes about the mouth of the Rondel river,
bending the reeds in the dykes and rousing ripples in
the lengthening grass. Mellis was mounted on a modest
nag whose brown coat and sleepy ears were more suited
to the russet cloak she wore than to the brighter colors
underneath it. Gilbert marched at her side. His eyes
looked gray in the morning; the north wind had pinched
his courage a little; and he and Mellis were to part for a
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your heart up, sweet sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked down at him and smiled. Her eyes were
steadier than his, and more determined, and she was less
touched by the north wind. His nature was more mercurial,
more restless, not so patient when life’s adventure
dragged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel near home, Gilbert. I think I could live in the
Forest—like a wild thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woodmere must be all green, and the lilies white on
the water. The house is but a shell, they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes filled with a great tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart is there,” she said, sighing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flock of sheep passed them, being driven to the river
pastures. A great wood-wain came rumbling along, loaded
high with brown fagots. Mellis’s nostrils dilated, and her
eyes shone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a good ship, and what merchandise! I can
smell the Forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, with a note of recklessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh the merry, merry life, with the horn and the
hound, and the bed under the greenwood tree. Why did
our people wear the wrong color, sister? Our hearts were
red, and the color beggared us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart is the color of fire,” she answered him, “and
I let it burn with the thought of vengeance. When will
you begin to tell me your secrets?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very soon, sister. I want no listeners within a mile of
us. You see how discreet I am! Gawdy Town is a pest of
a place; even the dogs do their spying; and there is always
the chance of your getting a knife in your back.
That is why I thought it better that you should go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever found me a coward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear heart, you are too brave, and such courage may
be dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were leaving the marshes behind them, and the
Rondel had taken to itself glimmering green lines of
pollard willows. Little farmsteads dotted the long northward
slope of the hills. Here and there the Forest showed
itself, thrusting a green headland into the cornlands and
the meadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gilbert was on the alert. Presently he pointed to an
open beech wood that spread down close to the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is our council chamber, Mellis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It should serve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can tie up the nag and see how my friend the
cook has filled your saddle-bags.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned aside into the beech wood, tethered the
horse, and sat down under a tree. They were hidden from
the road; the gray trunks hemmed them in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gilbert was examining the saddle-bags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That cook is a brave creature! Good slices of bread
with meat in between. And a bottle of wine. There is
enough stuff here to last you for days. Dear Lord, what
trouble I was at to explain my buying of that sorry old
nag!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set one of the bags between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for dinner and a gossip. There are two words
that you must never utter, Mellis, save when some one
challenges you with the question, ‘What of Wales?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And those words?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are ‘Owen Tudor.’ They will win you friends where
friends are to be had, but also they might hang you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our plans have not gone so badly. Our king across the
water is a shrewd gentleman. Our business is to stir up a
hornets’ nest in these parts; others will play the same
game elsewhere, so that Crooked Dick shall be stung in
a hundred places while Lord Harry is crossing the sea.
Roger Bland is our arch enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew in a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I forget it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tsst!—not too much fire! He is the very devil for
cunning. We have got to hold him in these parts, so
worry him that he cannot march and join the Hunchback
when spears will be precious to that king. They will find
a dozen fires alight in every corner of the kingdom, and
if our Harry wins the day, Woodmere will be ours again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She uttered a fiercer cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And blood shall pay for blood. Oh, I am no sweet
saint, Gilbert. That man dragged our father at his horse’s
heels, and then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke off as though the words were too bitter to
be spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gilbert’s eyes had hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forgive me for feeling merry at times. Well,
sister, I stay on in Gawdy Town, as you know, to wait
for news, and to watch for the men who will come over
the sea. Old John Falconer is our watchdog in the Forest.
The Blounts and the Ropers are with us; also a dozen
more. We ought to muster three hundred men when the
day comes. The Flemming is a jewel. His pack mules have
smuggled war gear and stores into the Forest. There are
three suits of armor, besides bills and salets and jacks
hidden in our cellar under the south tower. There is a big
beam, too, in the sluice ditch to throw across the gap in
the trestle bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay back against the tree, thinking deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Father Jude on the Black Moor is a close-mouthed
old worthy. He is a man who asks no questions,
and there is money to be made by such people; a fellow
who can mind his own business is worth his wage. There
is not a wilder place in the Forest. You will lodge there
in the pilgrim’s house; the Benedictines of Paradise are
bound to feed and lodge any traveler who passes that
way. Besides, Father Jude is one of us; the man has some
bitter grudge against the Lord of Troy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I am a pilgrim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Under a vow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how shall I serve you, on the top of a moor?
It seems foolishness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If a man goes to shrive himself or to pray at a holy
place, can folk quarrel with him? That butcher villain
of a Vance has his spies everywhere. A bird does not fly
straight to its nest when a cat is about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, sister, it would be well if you could steal your
way to Woodmere, and see with your own eyes that
things are as old Falconer and the Flemming say they
are. The cellar trap is hidden under a pile of loose stones;
a stout stake through the ring will raise it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could find my way to Woodmere in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a wench you are for wandering! You have that
money safely? I might have my purse cut in Gawdy. You
must play Jew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand to her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They talked awhile of all that was in their hearts and
of the great adventure that lay before them. Mellis was
as serious as he was gay; his flippancy increased as the
time slipped by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have a tale to spin, oh false woman who passed
as my sister! I am a Jack without a Jill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet his eyes were sad. A gradual melancholy took hold
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kiss me, child; we must be parting. Keep a brave
heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed him with sudden tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God guard you, my brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have a cat’s lives!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jumped up and went to unfasten her nag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember, this good priest will ask no questions. He
is a kind soul, and will swear to any lie, so they tell me.
Up with you, sweetheart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strapped on the saddle-bags, helped her to mount,
and led her horse out of the wood. There was not a soul
to be seen on the road, and still he seemed loth to leave
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go with you a little way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him dearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I am brave. And there is no one here to see us
part, and to gape and wonder concerning us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, oh queen! And so, farewell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed his cap at her, laughed, and went off
whistling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a sudden strange sadness assailed her. She held
her horse in and sat there watching him. He was so
gallant, so debonair, this brother of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she would never set eyes on him again. No prophetic
instinct could tell her that.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter X</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Geraint made his way through the
dusk to Widow Greensleeve’s house at Cherry
Acre. It was a warm, still night, and the scent of
the white thorn blossom in the hedges hung heavy on
the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came to the gate and stood listening. There was no
sound to be heard save the rush of the river through the
sluices of the mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint pushed the gate open and peered about under
the apple trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening to you, holy sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one was laughing close to him in the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, not know my voice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and see. Have you forgotten the seat by the
hedge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust the apple boughs aside, and saw the white
kerchief that covered her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saying her prayers somewhere. I have not seen her
since noon. She is touched in the head, and goes wandering
for hours together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint sat down on the bench beside the dame. He
was in a sullen mood, and very bitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fool! Send her back to the moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She swears she will not go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Martin Valliant is the devil. She could make
nothing of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my good man, it was he who made a Magdalene
of her. She came back crying, ‘He is a saint. There is
no man in Paradise fit to lace his shoes!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint cursed under his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pest take both of them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rapped his shoulder sharply with her knuckles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A word of warning, Dom Geraint. If the man is dangerous,
the girl may prove more so. I tell you he has
worked a miracle with her, and women are strange creatures.
She says openly, ‘Some day Martin Valliant will
come down from the moor, and make an end of the
wickedness in Paradise.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She says that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and dreams of it. I tell you women are strange
creatures when love has its way. She is all for turning
anchoress, and praying all day to St. Martin. For half a
cup of milk she would go running through the valley,
screaming the truth. Be very careful, Dom Geraint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned forward, glowering and biting his nails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have made a poor throw, dame. And here is that
pestilent pedant of an abbot threatening us with a visitation.
We have heard of the storm he raised at Birchhanger;
he trampled on the whole priory there, had one
of the brothers hanged by the judge on circuit. Privilege
of clergy, forsooth! The Church is to be regenerated!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rocked to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this Martin Valliant, the very man to play the
holy sneak! A pretty pass indeed! A cub we took in and
nurtured!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman touched his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some men are too good for this world. They are so
much in love with the next world——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed discordantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That they should be kicked into it! By my bones,
there’s truth in that! It had entered my head, dame. And
after all it is but doing a saint a service to help him to a
halo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tsst—you are too noisy! Have a care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew closer together on the bench till their heads
were nearly touching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate is not about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll come back singing a litany. We shall hear her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the girl was nearer than either of them dreamed.
She had come wandering silently along the path soon
after Geraint had entered the garden, and their voices
had warned her. She was standing on the other side of
the hedge within two yards of the bench, her hands
clenched, her face white and sharp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could hear all that they said to each other, and it
was sufficient to make her wise as to what was in Geraint’s
heart. She realized how his brethren at Paradise hated
Martin, and how they wished him out of the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate heard Geraint stirring at last. There were sounds
from the other side of the hedge, sounds that made her
wince. She crept away, step by step, till a turn of the
path hid her from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gate shut with a clatter. She heard the monk give
a great yawn, and then his heavy steps dying away beyond
the orchard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate stood very close to the hedge and shivered. Life
had so changed for her; she was horrified at things that
she had hardly understood before; men seemed contemptible
creatures. She was thinking of what she had
overheard, and of the treachery that threatened Martin
Valliant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate had kept her promise, and the very keeping of it
had strengthened her heart; but that night she was persuaded
to break it, nor could her conscience find fault
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There would be a moon in an hour. She crept around
to the stable that stood some way from the house, put a
halter on the old gray donkey, and got the beast out with
scarcely a sound. He was as stubborn as any ass could be
in most people’s hands, but he had a liking for humoring
Kate. She led him down the orchard, through the slip
gate into the dame’s meadow, and so away over the open
country to the bridge at the mill. No one saw her cross the
river, though the miller nudged his wife when he heard
the donkey’s hoofs on the timber of the bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now who would you guess that to be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good wife ran to the window, but saw nothing,
since the moon was not up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An ass, by the sound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two of them, more likely. And supposing it were
Kate Succory, where would she be going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is best to mind one’s business, John, when we live
at the prior’s mill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember it, dame, by all means,” he said, somewhat
sullenly, “there is not an honest man among them now
that Martin Valliant is away on the moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wife clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe that ass travels as far as the moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get you to bed. A woman’s tongue stirs up too much
mire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate did not trouble her head as to whether anyone
had seen her from the mill. She set the donkey’s nose for
the Forest, and helped him with her heels. Luckily, she
knew the way, and soon the moon came over the hill to
help her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A blessing on you, Master Moon,” she said quite
solemnly, looking over the donkey’s tail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock at Paradise was striking midnight when Kate
saw the Black Moor lying dim and mysterious under the
moon. More than once she had been shrewdly frightened
in the deeps of the woods; but old Jock was the most
stolid of mokes, and the beast’s steadiness had comforted
her. She had stretched herself on his back, her arms about
his neck, her face close to his flopping ears, and had
talked to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s afraid, Jock? I can say a Mater Maria and a
Pater. Besides, we are on a good errand, and the saints
will watch over us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jock, by his silence, most heartily agreed with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dom Geraint is a treacherous villain. The lean, black
rat! Some day Abbot Hilary will send for Martin Valliant
and will make him prior.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat up straight on Jock’s back as the donkey climbed
the moor. The place had a magic for her. She could
imagine all sorts of miraculous things happening where
Martin Valliant lived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly he will be a very great saint,” she said to
herself, “and people will come to him to be healed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she saw the cross standing out against the
sky, and it stirred her almost to passionate tears. She
slipped off Jock’s back, fastened him to a stunted thorn,
and went on alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything was very still. In the far south the sea
glimmered under the moon. Kate went forward with a
strange, exultant awe in her heart. Martin would pardon
her for breaking her promise when he knew why she had
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The buildings were black and solemn, though a faint
ray of light shone from the window of the chapel. It was
the vigil of St. Florence, and Martin had left two candles
burning on the altar while he slept for an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate looked into the chapel and found it empty. She
knelt on the threshold, put her hands together, and said
a prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was sound asleep in his cell, but he
awoke to the sound of some one knocking. He sat up on
his pallet, and listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew her voice, and for a moment he would not
answer her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant, be not angry with me. I am not
breaking my vow to you; no, not in the spirit. I have
come to warn you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child, what mean you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beware of Brother Geraint, beware of the monks of
Paradise. They go about to do you a great wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose to his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen. I speak what is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She told him of the things she had heard Geraint
whisper in the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are evil men, and mean treachery toward you.
I could not rest, Martin Valliant, because you are a good
man, and taught me to see the Christ.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she said, “Pray for me, Martin Valliant,” and
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rose up and opened the door of the cell, but
she was out of sight over the edge of the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood there a long while, rigid, wide-eyed, a young
man amazed that older men should be so base.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis Dale had passed the night sleeping under
a thorn tree in Bracknell Wood, with a pile
of last year’s bracken for a bed. The thorn tree
had stood as a green and white pavilion, and there was a
forest pool among the birch trees of Bracknell that had
served her both as a labrum and a mirror. She broke her
fast to the sound of the singing of the woodlarks, and
with the sunlight playing through the delicate tracery of
the birches. Her brown nag was cropping the wet grass in
a little clearing where she had tethered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis’s eyes were full of a quiet tenderness that morning.
She was a Forest child, and its sounds and scents and
colors were very familiar and very dear. She was as forest-wise
as any ranger or woodman, and was as much part of
its life as the birds or the deer or the mysterious woodland
streams and the brown pools where the dead leaves lay
buried. A great content possessed her. She had no fear
of the wild life or of a bed under the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had been up some hours before she saddled
her nag and rode forward through Bracknell Deep. She
knew all the ways, though Woodmere lay three leagues
to the north-west, and the Black Moor two leagues to the
east of it. She felt no need of hurrying. The deep woods
delighted her; her dark eyes seemed to fill with their
mystery; their silence soothed her heart. Life was a great
adventure, a game of hide-and-seek in a garden where
every path and nook and thicket were unknown. She was
strong and comely and full of the pride of her youth; her
breath was sweet, her black hair fell to her knees, her lips
were as red as the berries on a briar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was hoeing weeds in Father Jude’s
garden when Mellis rode her brown nag up the southern
slope of the Black Moor. There was no life in Martin’s
labor; his eyes had a dull look as though some pain
gnawed at his vitals. His heart had discovered a new bitterness
in life, for the words that Kate Succory had spoken
to him in the night kept up a tumult in his brain. He
had begun to understand many things that had seemed
obscure and meaningless. He even realized why he was
hoeing weeds on the top of a lonely moor. The very men
whose life he had shared were filled with malice against
him, and, like Joseph’s brethren, were trying to sell him
into bondage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard the tramp of Mellis’s horse, and his new-born
mistrust stood on the alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I fear anything that walks the earth,”
he thought, “man, woman, or beast? They are but creatures
of flesh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then he discovered himself standing straight as a
young ash tree, resting his hands on the top of the handle
of the hoe, and staring over the hedge into a woman’s
eyes. He could see her head, shoulders and bosom; the
green hedge hid the rest of her. But if Martin had dared
to scoff at Dame Nature, that good lady was quick and
vigorous with her retort. She showed him this girl, black-haired,
red-lipped, flushed with riding, sitting her horse
with a certain haughtiness, her head held high, her white
throat showing proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are Father Jude?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin could have stammered with a sudden, wondering
awe of her. Her eyes were fixed on him questioningly,
and with an intentness that heralded an incipient
frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Jude is no longer here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lies sick at Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The frown showed now on her forehead. Her eyes lifted
and gazed beyond him, and Martin Valliant had never
seen such eyes before. His mistrust of her had vanished,
he knew not why. Paradise had no knowledge of such a
creature as this. She had ridden out of the heart of a
mystery, and her face was the face of June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fools!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was angry, perplexed. And then she smiled down
at Martin with quick subtlety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your pardon, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled whole-heartedly as she took stock of his
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I saying! I have a vow of silence upon me,
save that I may speak to such as you. I am a pilgrim. I
had a fellow-pilgrim with me, but she fell sick at Burchester,
and I rode on alone. Father Jude’s name was put
in my mouth by the prioress of Burchester. Is there not a
pilgrim’s rest-house here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was still full of his wonder at her
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly. This is the chapelry of St. Florence. The
good saint so willed it that all who passed this way should
have food and lodging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face had changed its expression. She showed a
sudden reticence, a cold pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“St. Florence has my thanks. Will you send your
servant to take my horse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gaped at her, as though overcome by the thought
that this creature of mystery was to move and breathe in
the guest-house next his cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to save his dignity by taking refuge in sententiousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the servant of St. Florence and of all those who
tarry here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him guardedly, and seemed to realize
his unworldliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be no great burden. A stall for the horse and a
roof for my own head. I can look to my own horse, if you
will show me the stable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin let the hoe drop out of his hands. He went
striding along the hedge as though some enchantment
had fallen upon him. But she was out of the saddle by
the time he reached the gate, and, by the way she carried
herself, more than fit to deal with her own affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the stable, there by the woodstack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the door locked? No? I thank you, good father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He loitered about there like a great boy, feeling that
he ought to help her, but that she did not desire his
help. She seemed to have a way of taking possession of
things. He could see her removing the saddle and bridle
from her horse, and presently she was at the haystack
gathering up some of the loose hay in her arms. She had
left her brown cloak in the stable, and her blue spencer
and green gown made Martin think of some rich blue
flower on a green stalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next he saw her handling a bucket, and this time the
spirit moved him. He went across to her with boyish
gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spring is down the hill. I will fetch the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him the bucket with an air of unconcern.
Her hand touched his, and thrilled him to the shoulder,
but she did not so much as notice that she had touched
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Father——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be too heavy for you to carry,” he said
bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she turned back into the stable as though she had
not heard him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant went down to the spring with a most
strange sense of self-dissatisfaction. He filled the bucket,
balanced it on the rough stones that formed a wall around
the spring, and stared at his own reflection in the water.
The thought struck him that he had never looked at
himself in that same way before, critically, with a personal
inquisitiveness. A new self-consciousness was being
born in him. He stood there brooding, wondering if
other men——</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he rebuked himself with fierce severity, and
carried the bucket back up the hill. Mellis was not in
the stable, so he watered the horse and stared at the
saddle and bridle hanging on the wall as though they
could tell him who she was and whence she came. It
occurred to him that she might be hungry, and at the
same time he remembered that the food in his larder was
hardly fit for a sturdy beggar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This struck him as an absolute disaster. He went guiltily
to his cell, and took out what by courtesy he called bread.
It was of his own baking, a detestable piece of alchemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He weighed it in his hand, and found himself thinking
of the lithe way in which she moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They bake good bread at Paradise,” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quite ridiculous anger attacked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean hounds! This chapelry should be better served.
A couple of mules with panniers——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went forth, stroking his chin dubiously, and looking
at the bread he carried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor stuff for such a pilgrim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door of the little rest-house stood open, showing
its oak table and benches, and the rude wooden pallets
that served as beds. Mellis was standing behind the table,
unpacking one of her saddle-bags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This bread——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt his face growing hot. Her eyes regarded him
with momentary amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that—bread?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is as God made me make it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was smiling. His quaint humility touched her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will take your bread, Father Martin, and in exchange
you shall eat some of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took out a manchet wrapped in white butter cloth
and held it out to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put your bread upon the table. I dare vow it cost you
much honest—labor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had nearly said “cursing,” but his solemn face
chastened her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant took her manchet, handling it as
though it were something that would break. His eyes
wandered around the room and noticed the wooden
pallets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There should be some sweet hay spread there,” he
said to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis was watching him, but with no great interest.
For the moment life called to her as a fierce and impetuous
adventure. She had no use for a man who wore
the dress of a priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will keep this bread for the altar,” he said suddenly,
feeling that he had no excuse for loitering any longer in
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour or more Martin Valliant went about his
work with grim thoroughness. He fetched more water
from the spring, cut up wood for kindling, swept out the
chapel and his cell, and looked into the press where he
kept his vestments to see that the moths had not been
at work. Yet all the while he had his mind’s eye on the
door of the rest-house; his thoughts wandered, no matter
how busy he kept his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was standing at the doorway of the chapel, polishing
one of the silver candlesticks that stood on the altar, when
Mellis came out of the rest-house and turned her steps
toward the great wooden cross. She passed close to the
chapel in wandering toward the highest point of the moor,
and her eyes rested for a moment on Martin Valliant and
his silver candlestick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may have been that she asked herself what this tall
fellow meant by living the life of an old woman when he
was built for the trade of the sword. At all events, Martin
Valliant saw a look in her eyes that was very like pity
touched with scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her go to the cross and sit down on the
mound. Her chin was raised, and she turned her head
slowly from side to side, as though to bring all the Forest
under her ken. There was something finely adventurous
about her pose. She made Martin think of a wild-eyed
bird surveying the world before spreading her wings for
a flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He conceived a sudden distaste for polishing such a
thing as a candlestick. He studied his own hands; they
were big and brown, and he knew how strong they were.
He remembered how he had straightened an iron crowbar
across his knee, to the delight of the prior’s woodcutters.
And when the big wain had got bogged by Lady’s Brook,
Martin Valliant had crawled under the axle beam and
lifted it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candlestick was returned to the altar, and Martin
went down to the haystack to fetch hay for Mellis’s bed.
The hay knife was in the stack, and he cut out a good
truss of fresh stuff and carried it to the rest-house. He
had spread it on one of the wooden beds and was crossing
the threshold, when he met Mellis face to face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have brought some hay for a bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He colored like fire, but her voice was casual when she
answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You vex yourself too much on my account, father.
Last night I slept out under a tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin spent an hour walking up and down behind
the chapel, raging with sudden self-humiliation. Why
did she treat him as though he were an old man or a
child?</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The next day came and went, a pageant of white
clouds in a deep blue sky, and the earth all green
to the purple of the distant hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant began the morning with a queer flush
of excitement, even of trepidation. The woman with the
dark hair and the wild woodland eyes would mount her
horse and ride away out of his life. And somehow he did
not want her to go, nor was he ashamed of the desire.
He found himself in awe of her, but he did not fear her
as he had feared poor Kate Succory. She was a mystery,
a vision, a strange new world that made him stand wide-eyed
with wonder. Her lips made him think of the holy
wine, pure drink, red as blood, and undefiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His restlessness began with the dawn. He rang the
chapel bell, went through the services, with his thoughts
wandering out and waiting expectantly outside the rest-house
door. For the very first time the spirit of dissimulation
entered Brother Martin’s life, prompting him to walk
up and down the grassy space outside his cell, hands
folded, head bent, as though in meditation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her door open. She came out, her black hair
hanging loose, wished him a calm “good morning,” and
went down toward the spring. She had gone to wash
herself there, to dabble her hands in the water. Martin
paced up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She returned, disappeared into the rest-house, and there
was silence—suspense. Martin Valliant kept passing the
open doorway, but he had not the courage to look in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Martin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He faced around with a guileless air, as though she had
been very distant from his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you speak to me, Mistress——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I have not told you my name! I am called Catharine
Lovel. I wish to tarry here for some days, if St.
Florence does not forbid it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never heard that St. Florence had set a boundary to
his charity,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I am the more his debtor in the spirit. This is
so sweet and calm a place. I come from a forest country,
Father Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very wonderful country,” he agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And should be pleasant to one who has been vowed
to a month’s silence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Martin agreed with her. She stood at gaze, her
hands clasped in front of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One cannot lose oneself with this moor as a guide post.
I shall ride out, Father Martin, and go down into the
woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the valley there the beech trees are very noble,”
he said; “I love them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, Father Martin, trees are nobler than men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pondered those words of hers all day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk was falling before she returned. The brown horse’s
ears hung limp, as though she had ridden him many miles,
and his coat was stained with sweat. Martin Valliant had
been standing in the doorway of his cell. He went forward
to hold her horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I so managed it that I lost myself,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face looked white in the dusk, and her eyes tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reached a river, a fine stream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Rondel. It runs a league away, and the woods are
great and very thick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That lured me on—perhaps. I found a ford, and pushed
my horse over, there are wild grasslands beyond all full
of flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never been so far,” he confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a great country, even wilder than my own. I saw
as splendid a hart as ever swam a stream come down and
cross the river. And now I am as hungry as though I had
followed the hounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw that she was weary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will look to the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glided down from the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor beast has had to suffer for my whims, father.
He will bless you, no doubt. And so good-night to you; I
shall be asleep almost before I have supped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant led the horse to the stable, took off the
saddle and bridle, and rubbed the beast down with a
handful of hay. He found the animal muddied above the
knees, and there were other matters to set Martin thinking.
The fords of the Roding were floored with sand, for
the Roding was a clean river and ran at a good pace. Of
course, the mud might have come from some piece of bog
or a forest stream. He was the more astonished that she
should have reached the river, and having reached it,
found her way back again through one of the wildest and
most savage parts of the Forest. The ways were few and
treacherous, and known only to the forest folk, and yet
what reason was there for her to lie?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second day resembled the first in its happenings,
save that Martin Valliant betrayed a more flagrant interest
in this mysterious woman’s pilgrimage. She rode out
early, and he hid himself behind a thorn bush on the
moor and watched her progress. She chose neither the
path that led to the beech woods, nor the road going west,
but turned aside along the track that made for Oakshot
Bottom. Martin watched her till she was out of sight, hidden
by the belt of birches that bounded the northern rim
of the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She returned earlier that day, and in a strange and
sullen temper. She let Martin take the horse, but her eyes
avoided his, and she had little to say to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I struck a fool’s country—all sand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be the White Plain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘White’ they call it! A good jest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of the birch trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, the birch trees! I remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her curiously, but she went straight to the
rest-house and shut herself in. Something seemed to have
gone very amiss with her that day, and Martin was honestly
perplexed. Were women made of such wayward stuff
that some dust, a wood of birch trees, and perhaps a few
flies, could stir such spirited discontent?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her horse to the stable, fed and groomed him
as though he were my lady’s servant. And again he examined
the beast’s feet, only to discover something that was
singular. One of the hind hoofs had red clay balled in it,
and Martin Valliant knew that red clay was not to be
found in that part of the Forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He picked the stuff out and stared at it, holding it in
one palm.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Oakshot is yellow, Bracknell is black,</p>
<p class='line0'>Troy is as white as a miller’s sack,</p>
<p class='line0'>The Paradise fields are as brown as wood,</p>
<p class='line0'>But red is the color of Bloody Rood.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He called to mind the old Forest jingle, and the reddish-yellow
lump in his hand rhymed with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bloody Rood? That is the Blount’s lordship. Young
Nigel holds the fee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He frowned and tossed the clay into the stall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin saw no more of Mellis that evening; she remained
shut up in the rest-house, nor did he leave the
limits of his cell. A new emotion had been born in Martin
Valliant’s heart—an emotion that was so utterly human
that the saint was fast losing himself in the man. Mellis
was growing more mysterious, more elusive, and Martin
Valliant’s imagination had carried him away at a gallop
in pursuit of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why had she ridden all the way to Bloody Rood?
Chance could not have carried her there, and what reason
had she for hiding the truth? The adventure had not gone
smoothly, to judge by the temper of her return. And what
sort of adventure could befall a woman in the Forest?</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the moment of that thought an utterly new look
came into Martin Valliant’s eyes. His nostrils dilated, he
stared fixedly at some imaginary scene, his hands clenched
themselves. Dame Nature had flicked him with her scourge
of jealousy, set him thinking about a certain young Nigel
Blount of Bloody Rood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant discovered his own manhood that night.
He had ceased to be an onlooker, a creature in petticoats,
an impersonal, passionless saint. He was going to take a
part in the adventure: to see for himself how life stood.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XIII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had little to say to him next morning when
he carried her a bucket of water from the spring.
She was standing in the doorway of the rest-house,
a far-away look in her eyes, her black hair caught
up by a piece of red ribbon and tied behind her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin did not dare to question her as to what she
purposed for the day. His own secret was too big for him,
and he felt guilty toward her in his thoughts. He went
back to his cell, filled a wallet with food, and laid it ready
behind the door with a stout hollywood staff that had
belonged to Father Jude. If the girl rode out that morning
he had made up his mind to follow her and leave the
chapelry to take care of itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going out to reconnoiter, he saw Mellis in the stable
saddling her horse. The hint was sufficient. He kept out
of the way and bided his time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not call to him that morning or offer him any
explanation, but rode straight from the stable past the
great cross and over the edge of the moor. Martin saw
her go. He slung the wallet over his shoulder, took his
staff, and followed, stopping at the rest-house door to see
whether she had left her saddle-bags behind. They were
lying on one of the wooden beds, so that he knew that
she purposed to return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a boy, Martin Valliant had tracked the deer, and his
following of Mellis was just as subtle a piece of hunting.
The old brown horse was jaded and stale, but she pushed
him to a trot down the slope of the moor, and Martin
had to run to keep her well in view. Luckily she was too
busy keeping a watch for rabbit holes to trouble about
looking back. When she reached the place where the track
branched she reined in, and Martin dropped down behind
a furze bush. Her indecision lasted only for a few seconds,
for when he raised his head cautiously to get sight of her
she was already moving along the track that made for the
Green Deeps. Martin’s nostrils quivered, and his eyes lost
some of their hardness. She had not chosen the track to
Oakshot Bottom; Bloody Rood and the Blounts were out
of court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brown horse appeared to be setting his own pace,
and she had to humor him because of his age. A fair
stride enabled Martin to keep his distance. He had to
follow very cautiously over the moor, watching her like
a hound, and ready to drop to earth should she waver or
look back. There was a moment when he thought that he
had betrayed himself, for she reined in her horse and sat
looking steadily back at the swell of the moor. Martin lay
flat in the heather, and presently she rode on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Green Deeps opened before them, wild valleys
choked with woodland, almost pathless, a region where
outlaws sometimes hid themselves. A narrow ride almost
choked with scrub and brambles followed the valleys, lifting
itself now and again over the shoulder of a low hill.
The woods towered against the blue, solemn and silent.
Sometimes a stream broke the stillness with a thin, trickling
murmur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were heading for the Rondel; Martin knew that
much, though this wild country was all virgin to him.
He had to keep in closer touch with her, for the track
disappeared at times, and Mellis threaded her way among
the oaks and beeches. He was astonished at the steady,
unhesitating way she rode, choosing her path when the
track branched, without any sign of faltering. The Deeps
were a great green fog to Martin Valliant; he was utterly
lost in them, save for the guesswork that they were traveling
north. All his wits were centered on the girl, on keeping
her in view, and pushing ahead quickly when he lost
her behind some leafy screen, on saving himself from
rushing into a betrayal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The track climbed a hill, and then the ground fell
steeply, almost like a green cliff. Martin saw the gleam
of water shining below the crowded domes of the trees.
It was the Rondel flashing in the sunlight between the
green walls of the Forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis was urging the brown horse into the water when
Martin reached the underwood at the top of the bank.
She had struck the ford, and he saw that the water was
quite shallow, reaching just above the horse’s knees. He
dared not break cover until she was across, and there was
every chance of his losing her if he fell too far behind, but
she rode her horse straight out of the water and on into
the Forest without glancing back. Martin tucked up his
frock and splashed his way across like Atlas plowing
through the ocean, scrambled up the far bank, and caught
sight of her at the end of a colonnade of beeches, a green
tunnel floored with brown leaves and bluebells. He started
running, keeping close to the trunks of the trees, ready to
dodge behind one of them if she so much as turned her
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s chase of her lasted another hour, and the farther
she led him the more mysterious she became. He was
utterly perplexed by the whole business, and astonished by
her miraculous knowledge of the Forest ways. He became
aware of a change in the green wilderness; the woods were
more open, the glades more frequent, and stretches of
grassland flowed here and there, all yellow with buttercups
and shining like cloth of gold. It was a more spacious country,
more beautiful, less savage, lush, deep, and mysterious,
sheltered from the winds. There were yews and hollies
here more ancient than he had ever seen. Great sweeps of
young bracken covered the open slopes of the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed a long rise where old beech trees grew.
Its solemn aisles opened westwards on a little secret valley.
Water glimmered in the green lap of the valley, and for
a moment Martin thought that he had struck one of the
reaches of the river. But something that happened ahead
of him brought Martin Valliant to earth, with his chin
resting on the mossy root of a beech tree. Mellis had dismounted,
and was tying her horse to a drooping bough.
They had come to the end of their journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw her go forward under the shade of the great
trees. There was caution in her movements. She kept well
in the shadows, gliding from trunk to trunk, not hurrying,
as though she wished to make sure that no human thing
moved in the valley below her. Presently she seemed satisfied.
Martin saw her walk out boldly into the open and
pass out of sight below the slope of the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not till he had crawled to the edge of the beech wood
did Martin Valliant realize what the valley held. A broad
mere lay in a grassy hollow, shaded toward the north by
willows, and ringed about with yellow flags and water
herbs. An island seemed to float upon the water, all white
with old fruit trees in bloom. A gray turret and the bare
stone gable-ends of a house showed above the apple blossom.
There was a little gate-house close to the water, but
its roof was gone, and the bridge that had led to it ruinous.
The charred rafters of a barn showed beyond the sweep
of an ivy-covered wall. Martin could trace the suggestions
of a garden, with old yew trees, hornbeam hedges all gone
to top, and a broad terrace walk that looked as though it
were paved with stone. The place had a still, sweet, tragic
look, lying there in the deeps of the Forest, its fruit trees
white with blossom, although no one had pruned them,
and the fruit they bore would rot in the grass or be eaten
by the birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was so astonished by what he saw, so
bewitched by the desolate beauty of the place, that he
had almost forgotten Mellis. She had reached the edge of
the water and was standing by a willow, looking across at
the ruined house. A sudden awe seemed to steal into
Martin’s eyes. Mystery! And she was the human part of it,
wandering by Forest ways to this island of beautiful desolation.
No chance quest had brought her to the place, and
Martin, lying there with his chin on his hands, felt a
strange stirring in his heart. Perhaps she had lied to him—but
what then? The very thought of it quickened his
compassion. In following her he had stumbled upon the
real woman—a woman whose eyes were deep with unforgettable
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth came to him like the opening of a book.
Tags of gossip tossed to and fro across the refectory table
at Paradise pieced themselves together. Woodmere, the
Dales’ house, sacked and burned by Roger Bland of Troy
Castle; old Dale with a spear through his body lying dead
under an oak tree. Blood shed for the love of a red rose.
Two children saved by a swineherd and shipped off in a
fishing-boat from Gawdy Town. Woodmere rotting in
the Forest, to please the Lord of Troy’s sneering and
whimsical pride!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had wandered along to what had been the bridge.
Two spans of it still stood, but the center arch had been
thrown down, leaving a gap of twelve feet or more. Young
trees had taken possession of the broken walls, and the
bridge-head was choked with brambles. There was no way
of crossing the gap save by thrusting a big beam or the
trunk of a tree across it, and such a piece of bridge mending
was wholly beyond a woman’s strength. Moreover,
there was a second chasm to be crossed where the drawbridge
had been worked from the gate-house, but the
drawbridge was a thing of the past. Roger Bland had had
it unchained and unbolted and dragged to Troy Castle as
a trophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant saw her walk along the broken bridge
and stand there baffled, and though there was the one
obvious and most natural way of crossing the water, it
never entered Martin’s head that she would choose it. She
came back to the landward side, and he lost sight of her
in a little hollow beside the bridge-head that was hidden
by bushes and young trees. He was still wondering what
she would do, and whether he had the courage to go down
and confess himself and help her, when he saw her rise
out of the green foam of the foliage like Venus rising out
of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had thrown off her clothes, and went as Mother
Nature had made her, a beautiful white creature crowned
by her dark hair. In looking at her Martin forgot that he
was a man, forgot his vows, forgot that there was such a
thing as sin. For there seemed no shame in her beauty,
and in that white shape of hers kissed by the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the bridge a little grassy headland jutted into
the mere where the water was clear of weeds. Mellis made
her way toward it, like Eve walking the earth before sin
was born. She stepped down into the water, waded a pace
or two, and then glided forward on her bosom, the water
rippling over her shoulders. Thirty breast strokes earned
her across. She climbed out at what had been an old mooring
stage for the big flat-bottomed boat that had been used
for fishing. For a moment Martin saw her stand white
and straight in the sunlight; then her hands went up and
her black hair came clouding down. It enveloped her like
a cloak, hanging to the level of her knees, like night
shrouding the day. She seemed to have no thought of
being watched or spied upon; the place was a wilderness;
she went as Nature made her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she was lost among the orchard trees, whose bloom
was as white as her body, and a great change came over
Martin Valliant. He let his head drop on the root of a
beech tree; he shut his eyes, spread his arms like a suppliant.
In losing sight of her he had rediscovered himself,
that striving, perplexed, mistrustful self nurtured on self-starvation
and physical nothingness. A passion of wonder,
shame, and doubt shook him. He lay prone at the feet of
Nature, trying to see the face of his God through the
smoke of a new sacrifice. Had he sinned, had he shamed
himself? And yet a deep and passionate voice cried out
in him, fiercely denying that he had erred. What wickedness
was there in chancing to gaze upon a creature whom
God had created, upon a beauty that was unsoiled? He
strove with himself, with clenched hands and closed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And presently a great stillness seemed to fall upon his
heart. It was like the silence of the dawn, born to be
broken only by the singing of birds. He opened his eyes,
looked about him at the green spaces, the blue sky, the
water shining in the valley. What had happened to him?
Why all this wrestling and anguish? Where was the thing
that men called sin when earth and the heavens were so
beautiful?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what shame was there in the vision that he had
seen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat up, drew aside, and leaned against the trunk of
the tree. The stillness still held in his heart, but somewhere
a long way off he seemed to hear a voice singing.
A great tenderness thrilled him. The earth was transfigured,
bathed in a glory of a light. Never had he known
such deep and mysterious exultation. He felt strong,
stronger than death; he feared nothing; his heart was full
of a sweet sound of singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis never knew of the great thing that happened to
Martin Valliant in that beech wood. She crossed the
water, dressed herself, mounted her horse, and rode back
through the Forest, followed by a man whose eyes shone
and whose face had a kind of awed radiance. She never
guessed that a great love haunted her through the green
glooms, and that a man had discovered his own soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when she reached the cross on the Black Moor,
Martin Valliant was there, waiting. He had run three miles
like a madman across country that he knew. She looked at
him and his face astonished her—it was so strangely luminous,
so strong, so human.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XIV</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Toward dusk the same day a beggar came trudging
over the moor. He was a most unclean and
grotesquely ragged creature, almost too ragged to be
genuine, nor had he the characteristic and unstudied gestures
of the true vagrant who cannot let ten minutes pass
without scratching some part of him. The fellow wore a
dirty old hood that once had been lined with scarlet cloth.
A white bandage covered his mouth and chin as though
he had some foul disease that had to be hidden. His brown
smock hung in tatters around his knees, and his wallet was
such a thing of patches that no one could have told what
color it had been in the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ragamuffin scouted his way toward the chapelry
with stolid circumspection. He seemed to have a liking
for the gorse and a hatred of the heather; his love of cover
led him a somewhat devious but successful course, in that
he reached the top of the moor without Martin Valliant
seeing him. Once there he crawled into a patch of furze,
and so fitted himself under the ragged stems that he could
see the chapel, cell, and rest-house and anyone who came
and went. Mellis was sitting on the bench outside the rest-house,
looking at nothing with sad and vacant eyes. Martin
Valliant stood reading in the doorway of his cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beggar had a particular interest in Martin’s movements,
in that he wanted him out of the way. The afterglow
had faded, and night was settling over the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil take that priest! They should have learned
before that old Jude was sick. And this damnable business——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The furze was pricking the back of his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pest on the stuff! And I have to tell the poor
wench——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Martin Valliant put down his book and come
out of the cell with a bucket in his hand. He was going
down to the spring for water. The man in the furze perked
up like a bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless him, he has a thirst, or believes in being
clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crawled out as soon as Martin had disappeared over
the edge of the hill, and went quickly toward the rest-house,
making signs with his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Martin Valliant, being in a mood when a man
walks with his head among the stars, had loitered just
over the edge of the hill, staring at a broom bush as
though it were the miraculous bush of Moses. But Martin’s
eyes did not see the yellow flowers. He was looking
inwards at himself, and at some wonderful vision that had
painted itself upon his memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore he was near enough to hear Mellis cry out
as though some one had stabbed at her in the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dreams were gone in a moment. He turned, dropped
the bucket, head in the air, nostrils quivering, and began
to run with great strides across the heather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the sound of voices reached him, one of them
speaking in short, agonized jerks. The other voice was answering
in a cautious and half-soothing murmur; the other
voice was a man’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s stride shortened; he faltered, paused, stopped
dead, and then went on again, skirting the thorn hedge
of the garden. It led him close to the back of the rest-house,
and he went no farther.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard Mellis cry out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God! Oh! my God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man tried to calm her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Softly, Mistress Mellis, or that priest fellow may hear
you. A man would rather cut his tongue out than bring
you such news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you were with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, we had just turned out of the ‘Cock’ Tavern.
The fellow dodged out of a dark alley behind us, and the
knife was in before you could think of an oath. The
bloody rogue went off at a run. I stayed with your brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence for a moment—a tense silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he die there—in the gutter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were like the limping movements of a
wounded dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was dead,” said the man softly, “before the watch
came along. There will be a crowner’s quest, but we can
keep a secret—for your sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sake! What does it matter? Oh, if I but knew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who struck that blow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some hired beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can guess that. But who ordered it—paid the blood
money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has scared me, I grant you; one is afraid of a blank
wall or a bush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger Bland of Troy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be that you have said it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in a hurry to go; his voice betrayed his restlessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Flemming is at work. Bide here for a day or two,
Mistress Dale. It is time I disappeared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, go. Let me try and think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gawdy Town is too dangerous now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, I am not afraid, but I think my heart is broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gabbled a few words of comfort, and by the silence
that followed Martin guessed that he had fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light in the west had faded to a steely grayness,
and the stars were out. Martin Valliant stood there for a
while, picking loose mortar from between the stones, his
whole heart yearning to do something, he knew not what.
He could hear no sound of weeping or of movement. The
silence was utter, poignant, unbroken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he heard her speaking, and he knew that it
was half to herself and half to God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he is dead! Dear God—you have heard. Why did
you suffer it? Oh, what a fool I am! Picked up in the
gutter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s hands were clenched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I see the old place to-day? The sun was shining.
Oh, dear God, why am I all alone? The boy is dead; you
let him die. And I cannot bear it—I cannot bear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor could Martin Valliant bear that lonely, wounded
agony of hers. It was as though she were drowning in the
waters of despair, and there was no one to leap in and
save her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis stood leaning against the wall, her face turned
toward it, her arms outspread against the rough stones.
She did not hear Martin Valliant coming, but she felt a
hand touch one of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She twisted around with startled fierceness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who touched me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw him recoil. It was so dark now that his face
showed as a pale surface; she could not see his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was awed, humble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be angry with me. I will go away if you wish
it. I heard you cry out—and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She guessed in an instant that he had overheard everything;
that touch of his hand upon hers had been like the
mute, tentative touch of a dog’s cold muzzle. Her flash of
anger melted away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is you? How long——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was there—behind the rest-house. I had run up, hearing
you cry out. I think it was God Who made me listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, God is a great listener!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was quivering with bitter emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He listens, but He does not help. He has no pity. Yes,
it is quite true; you know all that should have been kept
secret. You know that I lied to you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not remember it,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I called myself Catharine Lovel—that I was
vowed to silence, and on a pilgrimage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forgot all those things,” he answered, “when I heard
the truth and your anguish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you will begin preaching a sermon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid,” he said; “I think that this night is teaching
me that I was not born to be a priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was silence between them for a while. Martin
Valliant did not move; he seemed set there like a statue.
She could hear his deep breathing, a strangely human
sound in the soft darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to speak again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you know that they murdered my father years
ago, and now they have slain my brother. We were the
Dales of Woodmere, and the Lord of Troy was our enemy.
Why am I here? Why was my brother in Gawdy Town?
Perhaps you can guess, if you are a man as well as a priest.
We wanted our home and the lands that had been ours;
we wanted revenge, we wanted a new king.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him challengingly in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you know all. We were traitors to Richard Hunchback.
We serve Henry Tudor. Now you can go to Troy
Castle—if it pleases you—and tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice began to sound a deeper note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s curse be upon me if I do any such thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked up and down, and then came back to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you not sit down, Mistress Dale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not the heart to feel weary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very still and calm by the great cross up yonder.
I will spread a cloak for you. We must speak of certain
things, you and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new manhood spoke in him. She seemed to question
it, and to wonder at the change in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am suspect, and have made you share my outlawry—is
that it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered with sudden passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She surrendered to him of a sudden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cross? Oh, very well. What have you to say to
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a man with the heart of a man might say. Am
I so poor a thing that I cannot take part in a quarrel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned abruptly, went to the cell, and came back
with a heavy winter cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dew is heavy on such a night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked side by side to the great cross, with a
sudden and subtle sense of comradeship drawing them
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin spread the cloak on the grass at the foot of
the cross. She sat down with her back to the beam, and
looked up at him in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me your man’s name—not the priest’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not the son of old Roger Valliant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes gave a gleam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of that old fire-eater! Strange!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a man of blood, my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with a new interest, a new curiosity.
His bigness took on a different meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great fighter and a fine man-at-arms, though he
fought for pay. And he made a priest of you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin felt her veiled scorn of all men-women, and his
flesh tingled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never questioned his wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never yet! Have you ever heard the trumpets calling?
But what am I saying? Yet men must fight, Father Martin,
sometimes, or be dishonored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is possible,” he confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bishops and abbots have ridden into battle before
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True. The cause may sanctify the deed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her bitterness returned of a sudden. She seemed to
clasp her grief, and press her lips to it with fanatical
passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Son of old Valliant—listen. Your father would have
understood these words of mine. Why do I not lie down
and weep? Why do I thirst to go on living? Because my
heart cries out against a great wrong—my wrong. Yes, I
am a wild wolf—an eagle. This is a world of teeth and
talons; your father knew it, and lived by his sword. And
I tell you, Martin Valliant, that I shall fight to the death—hate
to the death. My holy wine is the blood of my
brother—and I am not ashamed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood swaying slightly, with a tumult, like the clashing
of swords, in his brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the soul of the father dwell in the son?” he asked
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clenched his hands and answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will tarry here, Mistress Dale, so long as you may
please. No man shall lay a hand upon you. The Church
can protect—with the sword of the spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By her silence he knew that his words rang hollow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather have old Valliant’s sword,” she said
grimly; “but I thank you, Father Martin. My need may
be fierce, God knows!”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XV</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Noble Vance, the Forest Warden, came riding
into Paradise on his black horse, with two archers
in russet and green following at his heels. He
crossed the Rondel at the mill, and his scarlet coat went
burning through the orchards and over the fields. Such
common folk as saw him louted very low to the man, for,
though he rode over Church lands, he was a fellow to be
feared, being merciless and very cunning. Poachers and
laborers whom he caught chasing the deer had but one
thing to hope for from Noble Vance. He loved tying a
man to a tree and thrashing him with his own whip, and
the fellows he caught red-handed would rather have it so
than be sent to Roger Bland of Troy Castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a furlong from the priory gate the Forest Warden
overtook Dom Geraint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best of a May morning to you, man of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And God’s grace be upon you, defender of the deer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were gossips, these two, men of animal energy
who understood each other, and looked at life with the
same shrewd cynicism. Their eyes met whimsically.
Neither had any solid respect for the dignity of the other.
Their appetites and prejudices were alike; they met on
common ground and made life a gloating, full-blooded
jest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ride early, Master Warden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All for the joy of being shrived by you, Dom Geraint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut-tut—I am busy to-day. It would be a long affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so long, either; for you have only to name me any
sin, good sir, and I will say that I have committed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a mass of guilt is here—riding in scarlet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The black coat has its red in the lining!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They laughed in each other’s faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will come in and drink some of our ale?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such brown Paradise is not to be despised. I have an
hour to spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you a penance: not to look at a woman for
two months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fudge, good sir, I am out to tie one behind me on the
saddle this very day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The archers were sent to the buttery hatch, while the
prior’s parlor served Vance and Dom Geraint. Prior Globulus
had ridden out on a white mule to visit one of his
farms, and Geraint had no prejudices against sitting in the
old man’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vance drank to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May you have the filling of it, dear gossip. Then
Paradise will lack nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint gave blow for blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no man will stay me when I go a-hunting, whether
it be the red deer——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or others. You have a park of your own, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you—the whole Forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thin, sir—very thin. Game is scarce, though I am
trapping a fine young doe this very day. And here is the
jest, gossip Geraint; she has taken cover in one of your
thickets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint looked hard at Vance over the top of his mug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here—in Paradise! Rabbits, man! I know everything
that happens in Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who doubts it? But this is a great gibe, with that
woolly-noddled saint of yours serving as father confessor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I miss the scent, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I can keep each other’s secrets. There is some
trouble brewing about here, though I have not got to
the bottom of it as yet. Old Dale’s cubs had sneaked back
out of France; we sighted them in Gawdy Town. We
have the young man’s brush, and now I am after the girl.
She is going to ride to Troy with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint’s black eyes were on the alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing of all this, gossip. Where are you
going to find the lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the Black Moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Under the protection of St. Florence and Brother
Martin, and taking her sleep in your rest-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint gaped like a great bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blood and wounds, but this is—miraculous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to laugh—deep, gloating laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear gossip, I have not heard such monstrous good
news for many months. Brother Martin playing the nurse
to a woman! Why, sir, we sent him one, and he would
have none of her, the pious fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say Brother Martin could not help himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young woman arrived, claimed St. Florence’s charity,
and friend Martin had to give it. I could swear he has
kept the door of his cell shut all the while, and only gone
out after dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint’s mouth showed its typical snarl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s probable, most probable, but such a tale does not
suit us, good sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has the fool done that you hate him so heartily?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is too good for this world, Vance; I would that
you could help us to be rid of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red man grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, anything in reason! One bruises one’s toe against
these incorruptible lumps. And your toe may be swollen,
holy friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have done. This is serious to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak out, then; confess to me, Dom Geraint; I am
no suckling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint poured out more ale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for Abbot Hilary we should not care a snap of the
fingers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every man has a man over him, gossip, even if it be
only a grave-digger. My Lord of Troy—well, I would not
lose Roger Bland’s good-will. I should be a broken man
in a month, and I know it. You are afraid of this pup’s
yelping?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint nodded, and sat biting the nail of his thumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teach him to gnaw bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have tried it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But here is a pretty tale that could be told. Why, souse
me in vinegar, one only has to lie hard enough in this
world—see things crooked! Supposing I and my two fellows
dream that we found——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He painted the picture with a few coarse flourishes, and
Geraint wriggled in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great, sweet gossip—great! But supposing he calls for
a court?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him have it. He can call no witnesses. Madame
Mellis will not be forthcoming, and we shall be ready to
swear—for the jest of it. Of course a gold piece or two
for my fellows! These little mazes please me, gossip; brains—brains!
I’m tickled by a rebus! Now—what of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geraint stretched out one of his hairy paws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bargain, Vance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll hold the debt over you, and call it some day.
Prayers put up for me in Paradise—hey! No, a priest may
be useful on occasions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later he called his men, mounted his horse,
and set out for the Black Moor.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XVI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was Martin Valliant who prayed for the soul of
Gilbert Dale, and not Mellis his sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was bitter and fierce, and wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not ask God or the saints for anything—no, nor
Mother Mary. My brother had no sin upon him. Let
them look to their own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin tolled the bell, lit candles, and chanted a
death Mass, yet all the while he was thinking of the rebel
woman out yonder and of the despair in her eyes. Nature
was striking shrewd blows at Martin’s simplicity, using
the lecherous treachery of Geraint and the bloody heartlessness
of the Lord of Troy to prove to him that there
are great violences on earth, lusts and cruelties and loves
that no mere saint can conquer. Even Mellis’s wild words
of revolt sounded more real and human than the patter
of his prayers. He knelt a long while in silence, wondering,
asking himself grim questions. How would his father,
old Valliant, have acted? Would he have put up a prayer,
or donned harness and taken the sword?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis would not enter the chapel or kneel before the
altar. She went wandering over the moor, recklessly, with
that fever of anguish and hatred burning in her blood.
She wanted to hurt those men who had killed her brother.
She wanted to take the Lord of Troy and give him to
some strong man to be throttled. All the love and tenderness
that were in her were like perfumes thrown upon the
flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wearied at last, she came back to the great cross, passed
under its shadow, and entering the rest-house, lay down
upon her bed. The room was cool and silent, with its
massive walls of stone and thickly thatched roof, and not
a sound disturbed her; but she could neither sleep nor
rest because of the knowledge of the peril that threatened
her. Mellis felt herself betrayed, hunted, and her instincts
warned her that she would be shown no mercy. She did
not believe that her brother’s death had come about casually,
or that he had been stabbed wantonly or in error.
The shadow of Troy Castle loomed over her. She was fey
that morning; the Forest whispered a warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About noon Martin Valliant took his spade and went
out to dig in the garden. He was shy of Mellis, shy of her
despair, and the new manhood that had been born in him
chafed and raged at the vows that held it. The blood of
old Roger Valliant was alive in him; he was more the son
of his father than he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The garden hedge shut Martin in upon himself, and he
could see nothing of the moor, so that one of Noble
Vance’s archers was able to come scouting right to the
foot of the great cross and creep away again unnoticed.
The fellow went back to a heathy hollow where the Forest
Warden waited, sitting on his black horse in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woman is there, lording. I saw her in the doorway
of the rest-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the monk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard the sound of a spade in the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Now listen to me, you men. There is no cause
to be too gentle with the jade; they say she is a fierce
wench, and may carry a knife, and a knife in an angry
woman’s hands is not to be despised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you take her, or shall we, lording?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see what we shall see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was just turning a new spit when he
heard a sound that made him raise his head and listen.
A horse was moving somewhere; he heard the thudding of
hoofs and the jingle of a bridle. The horse came on at a
canter, and a man’s voice shouted an order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A view—a view! Run, Jack; head her off, or she’ll have
the door shut in our faces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Martin heard Mellis cry out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something seemed to twist itself in his head and snap
like a broken bowstring. He plucked his spade out of the
ground and went running, his nostrils agape, his eyes hard
as blue glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And this was what Martin saw when he pushed through
the gate and rounded the corner of the thorn hedge.
Mellis had her back to the wall of the rest-house, and a
light dagger in her hand. A man in red was sucking a
bloody wrist, and two archers were crouching behind him
like dogs waiting to be let loose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin saw the man in red raise the butt of his riding
whip and strike at Mellis, shouting savagely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Break the jade—break her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Martin Valliant went mad. He was no more than
the male thing answering the wild call of its mate. He
saw Noble Vance’s whip strike Mellis’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all over in twenty seconds, for that spade was a
grim weapon whirled like a battle-ax by old Valliant’s
son. The two archers had stood and gaped, too astonished
to think of bending a bow. One of them, indeed, had
plucked out a knife, but he was dead before he could
use it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vance the Forest Warden lay all huddled up, grinning
horribly, gashed to the brain pulp. The other archer had
taken to his heels, mounted his master’s horse, and galloped
off with the fear of God in him. And Martin Valliant
was standing leaning on his spade, his face deathly
white, his eyes staring at the dead men on the grass.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XVII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>For a long while Martin Valliant neither moved nor
spoke, and Mellis watched him in silence. His rage
had passed, and a kind of wondering horror dulled
his eyes. He was afraid of his own handiwork, this death
that he had brought into the world, these bloody things
at his feet. And yet they fascinated him, for there were
two men struggling in Martin Valliant—the poor monk
and the soldier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The monk in him, being the elder, stood shocked to the
heart, and most tragically dismayed. Such a bloody deed
as this seemed the end of everything, even though it had
been done in generous wrath. Martin’s monastic soul
shrank away, horrified, covering its face with its hands.
He had spilled blood, he was a murderer, he had sinned
against the God Who had given him life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while the monk in him possessed his whole consciousness,
but there was a man stronger and fiercer than
the monk waiting to be heard. The soul of old Valliant
lived more nobly in his son, old Valliant who had looked
on dead men with the pity of a soldier, but who would
have had no pity for such a fellow as Noble Vance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her voice, at first very soft and faint, like a
voice from a distance. He had not looked at her since he
had struck Vance down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly he seemed to drag himself from staring at his
own handiwork. He turned his head, and her eyes met his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the soul of that tragic day astonished him,
for there was a strange, shining light in Mellis’s eyes. Her
lips seemed to tremble; her throat showed proud and triumphant.
Here was no shame, no horror, but a something
that gloried, an exultation that was near to tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her as though he had been dead and she
had called him back to life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis stretched out her hands as though to crown him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant—Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the note of exultation sounded. He beheld a new
and human glory in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped on his knees, and covered his face with his
right arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman in her rushed instantly to comfort him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant, take it not to heart. God
slays men sometimes; it is right and good that they should
be slain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over him with infinite compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I lift this burden from you, you who have
striven to love men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped his arm and stared at the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened to me? I do not understand. Yet
that man there was an evil beast, and I struck him in clean
wrath. What does God wish? I have lost the light in my
soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up and began to walk to and fro with great
strides, his forehead all knotted, his mouth awry. And
Mellis watched him, keeping silent, but with a great pity
in her eyes. He was like a blind man, groping his way, lost
in the confusion of his own soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to her with dull anguish in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God will not speak to me. I hear no voice but yours.
I will go and surrender myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it matter? There is blood on my hands.
Let them do with me as they please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A new light flashed in her eyes. She seemed to feel the
struggle that was coming, the fight for the soul of this
strong man. Either he would dash himself to ruin, or she
would save him as he had saved her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no other voice but mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps God is in my voice, speaking to you, Martin
Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those men died by my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good—very good—I grant it. There’s death, lying at
our feet. Let us look at it boldly, without shrinking, without
shame. What were those men? One was an evil beast,
you say, and I know it to be true. He was one of those
who slew my father; I would charge him, too, with my
brother’s death, and by your hand I am avenged. There
were three, and you were alone. There was God’s good
wrath in your heart. And I call you proudly Martin Valliant.
Yes, the song of the sword is yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood rose to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is my sin the less?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if there be no sin in the killing of such enemies?
Think, why did you strike the man down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He avoided her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To save me. Because your heart told you that these
men brought me death—perhaps things that are worse
than death. You killed them, but I live and am free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled bravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Free—to be grateful—free to swear to you from my
heart that the deed was done nobly. And now—what of
the morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not rise to her rebel mood as yet; the old life
still hung to him, though he realized that it was a thing
of rags and tatters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow? I cannot think of a to-morrow. Life seems
to end for me in a great cliff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made herself look at the dead man, pointed at him
with her finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know whom you have killed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vance, the Forest Warden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger Bland’s watchdog. And you will hang for it,
Martin Valliant, in spite of twenty St. Benedicts. The
Lord of Troy is not gentle with those who flout him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered sullenly, “If I hang—I hang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis went closer, and looked steadily into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I, Martin Valliant, I shall hang on the same
gibbet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw his head back, with a tightening of the mouth
and a hardening of the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger Bland of Troy will not forbid it. We shall hang,
Martin Valliant, unless——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened and shut his hands as though blindly striving
to grip the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a broken man—but you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broken, say you? And before God—why? What are we
but rebels, outlaws, so long as Crookback rules and such
hounds as Bland hunt at his bidding? My troth is pledged
to another king. Broken?—never! What, shall I not fight
for my life against my enemies—aye, and with a good
heart? And you, Martin Valliant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—fight—to save myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you let them lead you off like an ox to be
pole-axed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have vowed——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God have pity on you, Martin Valliant. Where are
your vows now? Blown to the winds. No, I’ll not suffer
you to go with meek madness to your death. Answer me—will
you not fight for your own life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought awhile, and then answered stubbornly,
“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before God, then, will you fight for mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He faltered, looked at her, and his face flamed to her
challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For you? To save you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—to the death, so that you may live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out her hands to him, her eyes shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant, let us be comrades, let us swear troth
to each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he looked at her hands as though he dared not
touch them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a priest no more,” he said, “but an outlaw. So
be it, though God has dealt strangely with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his head and looked at the great cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shape of a sword!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a noble spirit in it, Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be a cross—and a sword,” he answered her.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XVIII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin Valliant became an outlaw, Nature
being stronger than the ingenious folly of dead
saints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mellis who captained the adventure, for she was
quicker in thought than Martin, and the day’s happenings
had stunned him not a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had her eyes on Woodmere, and both heart and
head justified the choice. It was nearer to Troy Castle than
the Black Moor, but this disadvantage was overbalanced
by many virtues. The place lay in the thick of the woods;
its broad mere made it very safe; and with but little labor
the house itself could be put into a good state for defense.
Arms and stores were hidden there. Moreover, it lay in the
Red Rose country, where the Forest folk were most bitter
against the Lord of Troy. John Falconer held Badger Hill;
the Blounts were at Bloody Rood, just south of the Rondel
toward the west. Mellis counted on the Forest rallying
to her when the secret word went forth that Richmond
was crossing the seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To horse, good comrade; or rather you and I will have
to march and load the baggage on my horse. Have you
much store of food?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a sack of flour, and some yeast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Empty your cupboard into a couple of sacks. I will go
and harness the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was looking at the dead men. He loitered
a moment, as though he could not decide what
should be done with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ll not touch them,” he said to himself. “I am a
man of blood; let others do what is right and good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He locked up the chapel and left the key hanging on
a nail in his cell, nor did he touch anything in the cell
itself save the food in the cupboard and larder. A couple
of sacks served for the stowing away of the flour, the yeast,
a bottle or two of wine, a paper of dried herbs, and some
salted meat. He tied up the mouths of the sacks and carried
them down to the stable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis showed herself a very practical young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fasten those two sacks together, and we can sling
them like panniers. Now, what else would make useful
plunder? A coil of rope, if you have such a thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin remembered seeing a coil hanging in Father
Jude’s tool-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait—and a felling ax and a crowbar. I’ll come with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They ransacked the tool-house, and Mellis blessed
Father Jude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rope, yes, and that felling ax. This is a treasury,
good comrade. Take that saw, and the mattock and spade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a crowbar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, brave man! We shall bless these tools to-morrow.
That big maul, too, and the billhook, and that auger hanging
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can use the rope to lash them into a bundle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Give me the saw, the auger, and the billhook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin laid the rest of the tools on the ground, and
lashed them together by the handles. He tried the weight
of the bundle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your horse will not bless us. I could shoulder these
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven miles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not the weight, but an awkward bale to tie on a
horse’s back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a sack and some cord; wrap it around the handles;
we can sling the food one side and the tools the
other. The horse must make the best of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her word was law for the moment, both to Martin Valliant
and the beast. She stood by while he loaded the
things on to the horse’s back, watching him critically and
the way he used his big brown hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you ride a horse?” she asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled around at her gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have broken in colts at Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that monk’s work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was young, and even a monk is none the worse for
learning to handle an untamed thing and to keep his
temper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded approvingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may help us. Can you use a bow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Passably. As a boy I used to carry a prodd and shoot
at the crows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The long bow for a forester; the arbalist is only for
townsmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could hit a sheaf of corn at fifty paces when I was
younger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have to grow young again. And traps—can
you set a snare as a bird-trap?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thinking of our larder,” she explained. “Outlaws
are not fed by ravens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun had swung well into the west when they were
ready to start upon their journey. Mellis went to the great
cross, and from its knoll she scanned the moor, but could
see no live thing moving anywhere. Martin stood by the
horse, leaning on his hollywood staff and staring at the
ground, trying to convince himself that he was not dreaming.
He saw Mellis come back and turn her head so as not
to see those dead things lying by the rest-house. Yes, the
business was real enough. He had but to look at Mellis,
and the knowledge leaped in him that the Martin Valliant
of yesterday was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see no one moving. The sooner we are lost to
view in the woods, the better it will be for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His tragic face touched her, but she let him alone, and
taking the horse’s bridle, started over the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin followed her like a dog. He moved mechanically,
watching her with a kind of sorrowful bewilderment,
marching toward the new world with a heart that was
very heavy. A man’s whole life cannot be overturned and
broken in a day without the shock of it leaving him dazed
and full of a dull distrust. To have become a murderer, to
find himself tramping at the heels of a young woman
whose eyes bewitched him, to know that there was a likelihood
of both of them being hanged—these amazing realities
hung heavy about Martin Valliant’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once or twice Mellis glanced back over her shoulder.
She had divined what was passing in Martin Valliant’s
heart; she half expected to find herself alone, or to see
him stalking away over the moor. Had she suffered less
herself, she might have reasoned with him, tried to spur
him against the world; but her own heart was full of sadness,
and sorrow is a great teacher. She had fought to save
him from his own fanaticism, and she had won a victory;
but she was too full of pity for the man to torture him
with more grim home-truths. Fate seemed to have tossed
them together into the unknown. She chose to let Fate
settle the matter. The man should be free to repent
and go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the moor and reached the beech woods
without adventure, and Mellis’s heart beat with a lessened
feeling of suspense when the green trees hid them. It was
one of those soft, cloudy, windless days when the Forest
seemed to gather an added mystery, and the great aisles
looked more solemn, hiding strange secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good to be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She breathed the words like a prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no cleaner thing than the Forest. The trees
have no sins to remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin did not answer her. He was gazing along the
green aisles and up into the tops of the great trees where
a vague shimmer of light played above the black branches.
The stillness was miraculous; not a leaf was moving; the
huge gray trunks looked strong enough to carry the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he fell to watching the figure of the girl in front
of him, with its gown of green that seemed part of the
woodland. She walked lightly, bravely, the horse plodding
placidly at her heels as though he recognized in her a wise
power that was to be trusted and obeyed. And in watching
her Martin Valliant was led toward a new humility, and
an unforeseen conquest of his own perplexities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her loneliness, and her courage in bearing it, that
routed the scandalized selfishness of the monk and stirred
the deeper compassion of the man. He remembered yesterday’s
despair in her eyes and the words of anguish he had
heard her utter. She seemed to stand alone in this great
wilderness, a wounded thing at the mercy of some brutal
chance, a white martyr to be torn and ravished by such
ruffians as Noble Vance. What were his own sorrows compared
with hers? How much more grim and real the dangers
that threatened her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden shame seized him; his eyes lost their sullen,
doubting look; his face became transfigured. He had been
worshiping self all the while, and, like a Pharisee, he had
broken into pious wailings because blood had spotted his
precious robe. Yes, he had made an idol of his own sinlessness,
bowed down to it, thought of it as the one great
thing in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soft green light under the trees seemed like the
light of a sanctuary, and an awed look stole into Martin’s
eyes. He followed Mellis in silence, nor did she speak to
him, and all the while that great change was working in
his soul. Here was something to serve, a thing of flesh
and blood, nobler than any altar of stone. He felt that
he could lay down his life for her, and that God Himself
would not turn from such a sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that moment Martin Valliant’s soul felt strong
and calm in him. His eyes no longer looked back at the
old life; he set his face steadily toward the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Mellis knew nothing of all this, of the man’s uprising
from the wounded horror of his blood-stained self.
They had come to the high ground, above the Rondel,
and could see the river glimmering in the green deeps
below. It was time to eat and rest, and she called a halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you footsore, comrade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; nor sore at heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a quick, searching look, and his face surprised
her. It was serene, steadfast, and its eyes were very
gentle. All that tangle of doubt and self-horror had been
wiped away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said nothing. He made a movement to take the
horse’s bridle from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will unload the horse and let him feed. There is a
patch of grass there. Sit down and rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pain wearies the heart,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall ride the horse and I will carry the baggage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but you shall not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will see,” he answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Martin who served. He unbuckled the horse’s
bridle and made a tether of it, so that the beast could
feed. Then he unloaded the baggage, opened one of the
sacks, and took out bread, meat, and some wine. Mellis
had thrown herself down under a beech tree where the
moss was like a green carpet, and Martin served her with
wine and bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes met his with a new softness. Something had
happened to Martin Valliant; he was a changed man. He
offered her a new calm strength upon which she could
lean, and in her loneliness her heart thanked him. She
wanted to rest, to close her eyes for a moment, to let the
burden of her fate lie for a moment on a man’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her eat, and forgot that he was hungry. She
had to chide him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No man is strong enough to go hungry. And there is
much work to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat and looked at the river flowing in the valley at
their feet. Martin’s memories of yesterday were growing
sacred; he hoarded them in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder is the ford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed with her poniard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was wise of us to halt here. That might be a dangerous
passage for us if enemies were near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But no hostile thing showed itself; the river was like a
silver dream in the green slumber of the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had finished their meal and rested awhile,
Martin roped up the baggage and untethered the horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will ride for an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis rebelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you cannot shoulder all that gear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slung the sacks over one shoulder, one in front and
one behind, and hoisted the tools on to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am younger than the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in his eyes persuaded her to humor him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good to be strong,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Martin felt strangely happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mounted, and they went down to the ford. Mellis
rode in to show the way, and Martin splashed after her,
planting his feet carefully, for the bottom was full of
pebbles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember the flour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time he saw a gleam of laughter in her
eyes, a glimmer of sweet youthfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall come to no harm,” he answered, smiling back,
and thinking her the most beautiful thing in the world.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XIX</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The day was far spent when they came to the valley
in the heart of the woods where the ruined house
of the Dales stood on that white blossoming island
in the midst of the water. Mellis had dismounted half a
league from the ford, and had refused to go forward until
Martin had loaded the baggage again on the horse’s back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am rested,” she had said, “and your strength is
precious. Let the beast bear the burden for which he
was born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had to hide the vivid memories of
yesterday, but as he stood at Mellis’s side on the edge of
the beech wood and looked down upon Woodmere, he
could but marvel at the strangeness of life. Here was he
beside her, her comrade in arms, an outlaw, a man who
had thrown the future into the melting-pot of fate. And
as he watched a world of tenderness and yearning swim
into her eyes, his soul stood stoutly to its outlawry. His
muscles were made to serve her, and he thanked God for
his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was our home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked long at it, her lips trembling, her bosom
rising and falling with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gilbert will never see it again. We used to draw pictures
in France, and in his fancy the apple trees were
always pink and white, just as they are now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin could find no words to utter. He wanted to
touch her, to make her feel that he understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she broke loose from these sad thoughts, rallied
herself to face the fiercer issue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The valley looks empty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They scanned it keenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will not leave us in peace for very long, and the
hours will be precious. Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin shut his eyes for a moment. He could not forget
that vision of her with her dark hair clouding about
her body. But the vision was sacred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, the bridge is broken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had to pretend his innocence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there is no boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is rotting in the mud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went down to the water’s edge, and Martin tied
the horse to one of the willows. He paid homage to her
forethought in the bringing of those tools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have to build a bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already she was pushing her way through the scrub,
and Martin followed her. There were two gaps to be
dealt with, one where the arch had fallen, and a second
where the drawbridge should have served.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The trunks of a few young trees thrown across.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—but the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could leave him on this side for the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at the gate-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. But we shall want a bridge that can be drawn
in, to keep out chance visitors. The gate, too, is off its
hinges, and broken. I know where a beam is hidden, but
I doubt whether we can lift it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the rope—and I am strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes looked him over with critical praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are bigger than your father. If we could throw
a couple of young ash trees across the first gulf. There is
a thicket of ashes down yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin needed no second word from her. He had the
tools off the horse’s back, and the ax on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over there. I’ll take the billhook and lop off the
boughs while you do the felling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They started away like a couple of children, full of the
adventure, and Martin was soon at work in a thicket of
ash trees that had been planted some twenty years before.
He chose a tree and had it down with six clean, slanting
blows of the ax, so that the cuts clove wedgewise into
the trunk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, brave man! That was woodman’s skill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell to clearing the trunk of its top and side branches
while Martin threw a second tree. He felled four, and
shouldered them one by one up to the bridge end, and
here his great strength served. These ash spars were no
broomsticks, and he had to spear them forward over the
gap, and keep their ends from dropping into the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brave comrade! Well done!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cheered his triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now a few willow withies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the bill, lopped off some willow boughs, and
then, straddling his way along the ash trunks, lashed them
together with the withies. The thing made a very passable
bridge. Martin tested it, and was happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few more trees, and some earth rammed on the top,
and the horse will be safe across.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—to-morrow. It is growing late. Now for the beam
I told you of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was lying in the sluice ditch under a smother of
brambles and young thorns, a great balk of timber all
sodden with damp, fifteen feet long, six inches thick, and
a foot in breadth. Two men might have shirked carrying
it twenty yards; but Martin, in that springtime of his love,
dragged it out upon the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good saints, but you are strong!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tossed him the rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw a noose around it. I can help at pulling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got the beam to the bridge, across the platform of
ash trees, and so to the place where the drawbridge should
have been, and here the business baffled them. The thing
was far too ponderous to be thrust across like a plank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin solved the riddle. He had to fell two more small
trees, lay them across, and straddle his way over. Then he
climbed the stair to the broken gate-house and bade Mellis
throw him the rope. The first two casts failed, but the
third succeeded. They swung the great beam across between
them, Martin keeping his end raised by straining
the rope over the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Mellis run lightly across, and scrambling back
along the wall and down the stone stairway built in the
angle of the gate-house, he joined her in the courtyard.
The sun hung low over the tops of the trees, and its level
rays threw the blackened beams of the burned roof of the
hall into grim relief. The whole place had been gutted,
with the exception of the little octagonal tower to the
south of the hall, and one or two outhouses lying beyond
the garden. The gate-house was just a stone shell, the
charred gate lying rotting in a bed of nettles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening light played in Mellis’s eyes, and Martin
Valliant held his peace for the moment. Her lips moved as
though she were repeating some promise she had made.
It crossed his mind that she might wish to be alone, so
he went back across the bridge and carried the two sacks
and the tools over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She called to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had opened a door that led from the courtyard into
the garden, and stood waiting for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us look everywhere. I want to be sure that no one
has been here before us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wandered out into the garden, a sweet and tangled
place, sloping toward the sunset. The walks had gone
back to grass, and the rose bushes were smothered with
brambles. The four clipped yews by the sundial had grown
into shaggy trees, and the herbs in the borders lived the
life of the woods. Wild flowers had taken possession,
buttercups, ragged robin, purple vetches, and great white
daisies. There was a nut walk that had grown into a green
tunnel; and a stone seat on the terrace under the wall of
the house was almost hidden by bushes that had sprung
up between the stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was a garden, and that was my mother’s seat.
Men are very cruel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet the place is very beautiful,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the beauty of sadness and of pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In one of the borders she found an old rose bush
that was budding into bloom, and one red flower had
opened its petals. Her eyes glimmered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—this is a miracle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She plucked the rose, kissed it, smelled its perfume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red is our color.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then a thought struck her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comrade in arms, you are for Lancaster; here is your
badge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him the rose, and Martin touched it with
his lips as she passed on down the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had explored the whole island before the sun
dropped below the trees. The only habitable place was
the tower; it had escaped the fire, probably because the
wind had been blowing from the south when Roger
Bland’s men had thrown their torches into the hall. A
newel staircase led to an upper room, and though there
was nothing but the boarded floor, the place was dry
and habitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin did not enter the room, but stood on the threshold,
as though some finer instinct held him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is plenty of old bracken in the beech wood,”
he said; “it would serve—for a night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was leaning her hands on the window ledge and
looking down on the sea of white apple blossom below.
Martin left her there, and, crossing himself, went out
to the woods to gather bracken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he returned he found her watering the horse
at the edge of the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can let him lodge in one of the thickets for the
night,” she said, smiling at the great bundle of brown
bracken on Martin’s back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A blackbird was singing in the orchard, and bats were
beginning to flit against the yellow sky. Martin carried
the bracken to the tower, and threw the bundle down
on the floor of her room. The door still hung on its
hinges, and he nodded his head approvingly when he
saw that it could be bolted on the inside. It was fitting
and right that she should feel secure in her chamber,
since she was the queen of the place and more sacred to
him than any lady in the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went for more bracken, and when he returned
with it he left the bundle on the flagstones at the foot
of the stairs. Mellis had found a sheltered woodland
stall for the horse, and had tethered him there with
several lapfuls of grass for his supper. Dusk was falling
over the Forest, and a great stillness prevailed. The surface
of the mere was black and smooth as a magician’s
mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin heard Mellis calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bread and wine—and then to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had found a rickety, worm-eaten oak bench, and
carried it out to the terrace above the garden. They sat
one at each end of the bench, using the space between
them as a table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow there will be much work for you, Martin
Valliant,” she said, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Work is the sap of life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, sententious man! You will build me an oven,
and I will bake bread. There are plenty of fish in the
mere, and some venison would help to stock our larder.
You will be a slave to-morrow, Martin Valliant; we have
to victual our stronghold and stop the gaps in its defenses.
Every day may be precious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could see that she was weary, and ready to yawn
behind her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and sleep,” he said, when they had ended the
meal; “I shall lie on guard, ready for an alarm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant, man-at-arms!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin made his bed at the foot of the stairs, and
slept across them, so that no one could pass save over
his body.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XX</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis woke on her bed of bracken soon after
the birds had broken into song. She went to
the window of the tower room and found the
valley full of white mist and the whole world all wet
with dew. The day promised gloriously, heralded by such
a dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she had said to Martin Valliant, every hour was
precious, for the Lord of Troy’s riders would be scouring
the Forest, and Woodmere would not be forgotten.
If she and Martin were to hold it as a strong rallying
place for their friends of the Red Rose, then it behooved
them to be up and doing before their ruinous stronghold
was attacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened her door, and going softly down the stairs,
found Martin Valliant still sleeping across them on his
bed of fern. And for the moment she felt loth to rouse
him, for he lay breathing as quietly as a child, one arm
under his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She touched him with her foot, and the result was
miraculous. He sat up, clutching the billhook that lay
on the step beside him, a most fierce and unpeaceful
figure in the gray light of the dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand! Who’s there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis retreated a step or two, laughing, for he was
a dangerous gentleman with that bill of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend, Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up, looking not a little angry with himself
for having let her catch him asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, daylight already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was loth to wake you, but there is much to be
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I who should have been awake, not you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked in a temper that wanted to catch the day’s
work by the throat and throttle it. Mellis stepped over
the pile of bracken and stood in the doorway that opened
on the courtyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One does not work well hungry,” she said, “and
we must talk over the day’s needs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hair hung loose, and she shook it down so that
it fell like a black cloak about her green-sheathed body.
The color and the richness of it thrilled Martin to the
heart. Her throat looked as white as May blossom, and
her eyes had all the mystery of the dawn. And of a
sudden a swift exultation leaped in him at the thought
that he was her man-at-arms, chosen to shield her with
his body, her comrade in this great adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day is ours,” he said; “I feel stronger than ten
men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her head, and her eyes held his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I am fortunate in you, comrade-in-arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could have taken the hem of her gown and kissed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis served the meal, and they broke their fast in
the garden, sitting on the oak bench and watching the
white mist lift and melt from the valley. The woods
grew green, the sky became blue above them, the mere
flashed gold, the flowers glowed like wet gems in the
grass. And Martin Valliant’s soul was full of the dawn,
the mystery and freshness thereof; the smell of the
sweet, wet world intoxicated him; the red rose that Mellis
had given him lay over his heart. He looked at her with
secret, tentative awe, and life seemed a strange and
miraculous dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to speak of the day’s needs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That bridge does not please me, comrade. We want
a thing that can be dropped and kept raised at our
pleasure. And then there is the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hinges and nails are all that are left of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have it. There is some good timber in those outhouses;
we could build a new gate. The curtain walls
are still strong and good. Then there is the gate leading
into the kitchen court; we could wall that up with
stones. We must hope to keep the Lord of Troy’s men
from crossing the water, if they come before we have
raised a garrison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She grew more mysterious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have other things to show you, but they can
keep till the evening. And now—as to the horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beast raised quite a debate between them, since
he complicated the matter of the bridge. Martin was for
leaving him tethered in one of the glades, and trusting
to luck and to Roger Bland’s men not discovering him
if they rode to Woodmere within the next few days.
And in the end Mellis agreed with him, since he was
to be responsible for the contriving of a drawbridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your plan has it,” she confessed. “I will go and
tether Dobbin in one of the glades, and then come and
serve as housewife. The man’s part shall be yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went to work with fierce enthusiasm. He had
a scheme in his head as to how the thing might be
done, and he set about it when Mellis had crossed the
water. He bored a hole through one end of the big beam,
ran the rope through the hole and knotted it. At the
other end he contrived a rough hinge by driving four
stout stakes criss-cross into the ground, with a crossbar
under them which could be pegged to the butt-end of
the beam. The pulley wheels for the chains of the old
bridge were still in the two chain holes of the gate-house,
about ten feet from the ground. Martin piled
some stones against the wall, climbed on them, and ran
the rope through one of the chain holes. The trick
worked very prettily. He found that he could raise and
lower the beam from inside the gate-house, and all that
was needed was a stake to which he could fasten the
rope when the bridge was up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis came back from the woods as he was driving
the stake into the ground under the gateway. He had
rolled his cassock over his girdle, and turned the sleeves
up nearly to his shoulders, so that the muscles showed.
And he looked hot and masterful and triumphant as he
turned to show her how his bridge worked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done, Martin Valliant. Let the beam down and
I will come over and see if I am strong enough to raise
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lowered the beam, and she walked over to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I understand why you did not want to build a
bridge that would carry a horse. Let me see what I can
do. I might have to play bridgeward some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found that she was strong enough to raise the
beam, for she was tall and lithe, with a beautiful breadth
across the bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes shone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I must build you a gate,” he said, “a gate that
nothing but a cannon shot can shiver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took him the rest of the morning to pull down one
of the outhouses, sort out his timber, and get it cut to
size and shape. He had dragged the charred mass of the
old gate from its bed of nettles, and had stripped it of
its great iron hinges when Mellis came to call him to
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have done famously: hot meat, and new bread, and
a dish of herbs. I found two old iron pots in the cellar,
and I am quite kitchen proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was loth to leave the work. He was hunting
for the smith’s nails that had fallen out of the burned
wood of the old gate; they were more precious than pieces
of gold. She pretended to be hurt by his lack of gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have cooked for my comrade in arms, and he will
not eat what I have cooked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin straightened up, and left his hunting for nails
among the trampled nettles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not churlishness on my part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. You must do things fiercely, Martin Valliant,
with your whole heart, or not at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My hunger is fierce,” he confessed, smiling gravely.
“No food could be sweeter than what your hands have
prepared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was shy of her, and voiceless, all through that
meal, and there was an answering silence in Mellis’s
heart, for though so short a time had passed since their
lives had been linked together, she was forgetting Martin
the monk in regarding Martin Valliant the man. She
began to look at him with a vivid and self-surprised
curiosity; his shyness infected her; she became conscious
of the deep wonder light in his eyes. Hitherto she had
been a creature of impulses, a wild thing blown along
by the wind of necessity; but of a sudden she saw the
man as a man, and her heart seemed to cease beating
for a moment, and her thoughts to stand still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was the very contrast of herself, with his tawny
hair tinged with red, and his frank, steadfast, trusting
eyes. Regarded as a woman, Mellis was a fine, lithe,
white-skinned creature, and Martin Valliant matched her
in the matter of bodily beauty. There was no gnarled
uncouthness about his strength. He carried himself like
a king’s son, and without any arrogance of conscious
pride. The soul of the man seemed to show in his movements,
a steady, gentle, unflurried soul, capable of great
tendernesses, of great wraths, and of strange renunciations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes grew wayward, more shadowy; they avoided
his. A new subtlety of feeling stole into the hearts of
both of them. The sun shone, the woods were green,
the wild flowers were bright in the lush grass. When a
blackbird sang Martin Valliant felt that the bird’s song
and his heart were one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke away, for the grosser hunger was soon satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not sleep till that gate is up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She brushed the crumbs from her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will need me. I will come when you call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was walking away when she uttered his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice had never sounded so strange and human
in his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a secret to show you—presently—when the
gate is up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went off, wondering, his eyes full of his new exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin worked like a giant, with a fever of love in his
blood. In three hours he had the gate finished and ready
to be hung, but the hanging of it was the devil. The
thing was monstrously massive and cumbersome to lift,
and too broad for him to get a grip of it with spread
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went in search of Mellis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can build my gate—but as to hanging it——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at his grim, baffled face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women are cunning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to help him, and spoke of wedges and the
crowbar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can steady the thing while you heave it up, little
by little, till the hinge straps are over the bolts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her a look from his blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man rushes like a bull. While you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, as I told you, women are cunning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between them they got the gate on its hinges, and
though it groaned and moved reluctantly, it was as strong
as a man could wish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No spear truncheon will prise that up in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was flushed and breathing fast, and her quick
beauty swept into Martin’s heart like the wind. He stood
still, gazing at her, till she looked at him, and then his
eyes fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See how strong that is,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his heart would have cried, “Strong as my love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main gate of Woodmere was safe now from a
surprise, and no enemies could attack the place save by
swimming the mere. Martin had made a round of the
walls; they stood twelve feet high and were strongly
built. The only other openings in them were the gate
leading from the kitchen court and the wicket opening on
the garden. The garden wicket still hung on its hinges,
a stout oak door studded and banded with iron, and
easily barred in case of an attack. The kitchen gateway
they had decided to wall up, and Martin set to work upon
the wall, using the big stones that had fallen from the
battlements of the hall. They were so heavy that they
wedged and weighted each other in place, and stood as
solidly as though they had been laid by a mason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had nearly closed the gap when Mellis called
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sun is near the hills. You have done enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his youth and his strength Martin Valliant
was very weary. He looked at the wall that he had
built, and saw that it was strong enough to stand against
a surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice came nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ever hungry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went whither her voice lured him. She had made
a table in the garden out of some stones and pieces of
wood, set flowers on it, and laid supper thereon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her dark eyes seemed to him to be deep with a new
mystery. They broke bread together and drank their wine,
and the meal had the flavor of a sacrament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is yet work to be done,” she had said to him,
“before the daylight goes. And I shall show you a thing,
Martin Valliant, that shall pledge me your honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had ended the meal she rose and looked
at him with great steadfastness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant, is your heart still set on this life of
the sword? Tell me the truth, and keep nothing hidden.
God knows that a man must make his choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes met hers without flinching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have chosen,” he said; “there shall be no turning
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went toward the tower, beckoning him to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not been idle, and here is my secret.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was her brother’s treasury that Mellis showed him,
the vault at the base of the tower, filled with war gear
and a store of food. She had raised the stone by thrusting
a long pole through the iron ring. A stout leather
sack lay on the ground beside the entry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are bows and bills and war harness below there,”
she told him. “We have fooled the Lord of Troy, who
swore that there should not be so much as a boar-spear
left in the Forest. Take that sack, Martin Valliant, and
carry it for me into the garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shouldered the thing, and knew that he carried
iron, both by the weight of it and by the way a sharp
edge bit into his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lay it on the grass—there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed her, wondering what was in her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis knelt and cut the leather thong that fastened
the throat of the sack. The leather had kept out the
damp, and her white hands drew out armor that was
bright as the blade of her poniard. It was a suit of white
mail beautifully wrought, yet noble in its clean simplicity.
Salade, breast-plate, shoulder pieces, back-plate, tassets,
loin-guard, vam-braces, rear-braces, elbow pieces, gauntlets,
thigh plates, greaves, solerets and spurs, she laid
them all upon the grass. And last of all she drew out a
belt and sword, and a plain shield colored green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spread her hands, palms downwards, over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was to have been my brother’s harness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was kneeling at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, God helping me, I have chosen the man
who shall wear it—even you, Martin Valliant, my comrade
in arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes seemed to catch the sunlight. He knelt
for a while in silence, as though he were praying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May no shame come to it through me,” he said at
last; “and though it may sit strange on me, my heart shall
serve you to the death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the sword and rose from her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My hands shall gird you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached out, drew the pommel of the sword toward
him, and kissed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear troth to you, Mellis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up, and her eyes held his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant you are called, and valiant shall you
be. Stand, good comrade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She buckled the sword on him, knowing in her heart
that he was her man.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant slept at the foot of the
tower stairway with Mellis’s sword beside him.
He fell asleep with one hand gripping the hilt,
like a child clutching a toy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis did not have to wake him that morning, for he
was up before the birds had begun their orisons, his
heart full of the great adventure that life had thrust
upon him. He had taken it solemnly, like a young man
before his knighthood, or a soldier setting forth on a
Crusade, and all that he did that morning in the gray
of the dawn betrayed the symbolical passion of the lover.
He was to enter upon a new state before he touched
that white harness, and so he went to the mere, stripped
off his clothes, and bathed in the water. Then he knelt
awhile, grave-eyed and strong, watching the sun rise on
the new day, while the birds were a choir invisible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mellis came down from her chamber she found
him in the garden with the harness spread out upon
the leather sack, so that the wet grass should not tarnish
it. He had cut his cassock short above the knees, and
was holding the salade in his hands and staring at it like
a crystal gazer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flushed, and glanced at her with an air of bafflement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These iron clothes are new to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis did not smile at his predicament, though she
guessed that he had no knowledge of how to arm himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must try the feel of it,” she said, “for a man
should test himself with the weight of his harness. Four
hands are needed for such a toilet. When we have eaten
I will play the page to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was as good as her word, and the arming of Martin
Valliant was an event in the life of the garden. Mellis
made him seat himself upon the bench, while she picked
up the pieces one by one and taught him his lesson by
buckling them on with her own hands. First came the
breast- and back-plates, the pauldrons and gorget, the
vam-braces and rear-braces. Then she made him stand up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may call that half-harness; a man can move
lightly and fight on foot, but when bowmen are about,
a man-at-arms should be sheathed from top to toe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next she buckled on tassets, loin-guard, cuishes, greaves
and solerets, set the salade on his head, and slung the
green shield by its strap about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, man of the sword!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood back and surveyed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is better than I had hoped. You are a bigger
man than my poor brother, but the harness covers you.
Of course you should be wearing a wadded coat to save
all chafing, and hose of good wool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes lit up as she looked him over, and she held
her head proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no spear to give you, though I doubt not that
you will make a better beginning with the sword—if
needs be. Try the joints, Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He walked up and down before her, raised his arms,
spread them wide, folded them over his chest. He seemed
made for such heavy harness; the strong, sweeping movements
of his limbs were not crabbed or clogged by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thing is like an iron skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! it was made by a fine armorer. The joints are
perfect. And the weight of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll swear I could run or leap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are fresh as yet. A man must wear such harness
for a day to learn where it irks him. And so I am
thinking that I will leave you to master it. There is
work for me in the Forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unhelmed himself, and his blue eyes looked at her
questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! You are venturing abroad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I shall take the horse, and your wallet full of
food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why must you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, brother-in-arms, because we are not the only
people on God’s earth who thirst to humble the Lord
of Troy. We have friends in the Forest, and I must see
them—take counsel, and plan what can be done. They
were waiting for friends from France, and for poor Gilbert
to give the word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered her with sudden fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I carry your brother’s sword and wear his harness. It
is my right to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at him with quiet eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear man, that would not help us; you could not
prove, as yet, that you are in the secret. Besides, all the
wheels of it are in my head. I shall ride to Badger Hill
and see John Falconer; he holds the reins in the Forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what of the Lord of Troy? Those dead men——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he know as yet? He may send out riders,
but I know the Forest better than any man that Roger
Bland can count on. I shall not be caught in a snare.
Moreover, Martin Valliant, I leave you to guard our
stronghold and the precious gear in that cellar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was very loth to let her go alone, and bitterly against
it, though he saw the wisdom of her argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart mislikes this venture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You run to meet a ghost,” she said. “I shall come to
no harm, believe me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had her way, and he went to open the gate and
lower the bridge while she put on a cloak and hood, and
filled the wallet with food. She joined him on the causeway,
where he stood scanning the woods mistrustfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would to God I might go with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes looked into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your heart goes with me. Bear with that harness, for
your bones will ache not a little. And keep good guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her cross the grassland toward the thicket
where they had hidden the horse. Woodmere seemed to
lack sunlight of a sudden, and his heart felt heavy when
the trees hid her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor were Martin’s fears for her safety the mere idle
qualms of a man in love. There was a saddling of horses
at Troy Castle, and Fulk de Lisle, Roger Bland’s bravo,
was shut up with him in my lord’s closet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vance’s archer man, who had escaped Martin Valliant’s
spade, had come in the night before, after losing his way
in the Forest. His tale lost nothing in the telling. Mellis
Dale had stabbed the Forest Warden with her poniard,
and her paramour, the priest, had then beaten him, and
John Bunce, to death. If my lord doubted it, let him send
men to the Black Moor, and they would find the bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Fulk de Lisle had his orders. He was a gay, swashbuckling
devil, very handsome, very debonair, a great
man with his weapons. He stood before the Lord of Troy,
leaning on his sword, his black hair curled under his flat
red hat, his sword belt bossed with gold. He wore no
armor save a cuirass, and light greaves; the blue sleeves
of his doublet were puffed with crimson; his hose were
striped red and blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take thirty men; let them ride in three troops. Go
yourself with one troop to the Black Moor; send Peter
Rich with ten men to Badger Hill, and Swartz with the
rest to Woodmere. I have sent messengers to Gawdy
Town. I want the wench and the priest, both of them.
And Vance’s body had better be brought in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle turned to go. This was work that pleased
him. The Forest had been dull and law-abiding for many
months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk faced about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you think to know the girl when you see
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say she is dark and vixenish, with eyes that bid
a man stand back, a well-favored wench.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush! Any pretty jade would do for you, man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oldham, the archer, can recognize them both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He cannot be in three places at once, Sir Fulk de
Lisle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He shall go with me. Swartz and Rich shall have
orders to take and bring in any likely looking damsel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, leave it at that. Waste no time. I am not patient
when such tricks are played me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Fulk de Lisle and his men rode out from Troy
Castle. They were lightly armed for fast riding, and ten
of them shouldered cross-bows instead of spears. They
kept together till they reached Red Heath, where Peter
Rich and Swartz broke off with their two troops with
guides for Woodmere and Badger Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mellis was on her way to John Falconer’s
house at Badger Hill. She sighted it about nine o’clock,
a great, low, black-beamed, white-plastered place, walled
around with gray stone, on the side of a sandy hill. Fir
woods, dark as midnight, climbed skywards behind it;
the farm lands lay in the valley to the south, but elsewhere
the soil was poor, and grew nothing but gorse and
heather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis rode over the heath and up the hill to the house.
A gawk of a boy, who was cleaning harness outside the
stable doorway, stared at her with a face like sodden
dough. She reined up in the courtyard and called to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Master Falconer here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy never budged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell Master Falconer that I am waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who be—I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run, you dolt, or I will get you a whipping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He vanished down a slope that led under one wing
of the house, and in half a minute John Falconer came
out to her. He was like the hill he lived on—a gray badger
of a man, grim, reticent, yet kindly. His short neck made
the breadth of his shoulders more apparent. His legs were
bowed and immensely strong. John Falconer was a piece
of the Forest. His hair and beard were the color of beech
mast, sanded with gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes brightened like a dog’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s death! Is it you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own and very self. And poor Gilbert—you have
heard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked grim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God hearten you, child! But what has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy reappeared, and proceeded to stare at them,
while he picked his teeth with a straw. Nor was John
Falconer aware of the youngster’s presence until he saw
Mellis’s eyes prompting him to turn his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man of Badger Hill gave a kind of growl, and the
child disappeared with a flutter of brown legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to find you, John, but I am loth to be seen
here by any stray fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The men are in the fields.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has no tongue when it pleases me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at the pine woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your dinner can wait I will talk to you up there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wise wench!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis fastened her horse to a tree, and she and John
Falconer walked to and fro along one of the black aisles.
She had much to tell him, and he seemed to grow grimmer
the longer he listened. His comments were short,
gruff growls and an occasional terse judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vance dead! May he burn like pitch! The priest
turned outlaw! What next? You have made him your
man? Nay—I mislike that. A black Benedictine! Lord,
but we are in for a storm!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer frightened most people, but he did not
frighten Mellis. She had known him since she was a
toddler of three, to be picked up and carried on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether you like it or not, John, these things cannot
be helped. Vance has made us run when we would have
walked. As to Martin Valliant, I would stake my right
hand on his keeping faith with us. And now—will you
rally to us? We can hold Woodmere till the whole
Forest flaunts the Red Rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would we had word from France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cannot be helped. If our people are loth to move—well,
I will disappear, go and live in one of those old
quarry holes by the Rondel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered her doggedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I am with you, if I lose my old head for it. I
am not so young as I was, and I would get my blow in at
Roger Bland before I am stiff in the back. I will ride
out to-night and warn our friends, and by to-morrow
we shall be able to throw a garrison into Woodmere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stubborn, trusty oak!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are many men who lust to feel their poniards in
Roger Bland’s throat. I pray that mine may have that
honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis did not tarry there much longer. Her work was
done for the day; she could leave the Forest folk to John
Falconer. She chose a different track for her homeward
ride—a way that plunged through the pine woods and
turned south again by Witch’s Cross. And she was saved
by her caution, for half an hour after she had left Badger
Hill Peter Rich and his men came riding along the track
she had used in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They found John Falconer at his dinner, and well
warned as to their business. He was bluff and easy with
Peter Rich, had ale drawn for the men and water for
their horses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rich did not beat about his business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a hanging job for any fool who meddles. We
are after old Dale’s daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, man! She has been in France these seven years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a good bit of brag, John Falconer. Come,
now; I have no wish to ride the high horse; the girl has
been here; let us have the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer told his lie with square-faced hardihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen Mellis Dale for seven years. You can
search the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rich had it searched to salve his conscience. His men
found nothing—not even the stable boy, who was shut
up in the venison hutch in a dark corner of the larder,
and far too much in terror of John Falconer to betray
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter Rich drank ale while his men were at work. He
took his failure philosophically, and got back into the
saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has saved me pulling you by the beard, John Falconer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My beard may be at your service—some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They grinned at each other like fierce dogs, and Peter
Rich rode off. But he left two men in the woods to watch
the place, which was a trick of no great moment, for
John Falconer guessed that he would be watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God the girl left betimes, and by the other
road. And God grant she may not find a trap at Woodmere
House.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was as restless as a dog
whose master had gone out and left him chained
to his kennel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His activities were various and many that morning.
He took off his arm-plates, covered his breast-plate with
a sack, and completed the walling up of the kitchen
gateway. The defense of the causeway and the bridge
exercised him still further, and he built a rough ladder
and stage to one of the loopholes of the gate-house, so
that a man with a bow could command the bridge. The
matter of archery piqued him to try what skill he had left.
He raised the roof stone of the cellar, searched out a bow
and some arrows, and going up on the leads of the tower,
tried shooting at a bush on the far side of the mere. Five
arrows missed the mark, but the sixth got home. And
this testing of his skill taught him something of value,
in that he discovered the tower to be the right and proper
place for a watchman. He could scan the woods, the
whole of the valley, and the island, and see into nearly
every corner of the ruined house itself. The battlements
were breast high, and gave good cover for a man with a
bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His armor was beginning to sit heavy on him, for he was
raw to it; but as to humoring his body, that was a surrender
that he refused to make. He returned to the courtyard,
took his sword, and practiced striking and thrusting
at an imaginary mark. It was a “hand and a half” sword,
heavy, and long in the blade, but very finely balanced. To
Martin it felt no heavier than a willow wand; he played
with it half the morning, cutting off the heads of nettles,
learning to judge his distances and the sweep of a full-armed
blow. From time to time he climbed the tower
and took a view of the woods and the valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun stood at noon when Martin Valliant caught
his first glimpse of the Lord of Troy’s gentry. He was on
the leads of the tower and looking toward the great
beech wood when he saw a man skulking under the trees.
The fellow wore the Troy livery of green and silver, and
carried a cross-bow on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin kept very still, and the steel of his helmet may
have toned with the gray stone of the battlements, for
the man with the cross-bow did not appear to see him.
He came out from the wood shade into the open, and
stood awhile looking at the island and the house. Then
he put a horn to his lips and blew a short blast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was still asking himself whether the man was
an enemy or a friend, when Swartz and his troop came
riding out of the beech wood. The sun flashed on their
breast-plates and helmets, and on the points of their
spears. Swartz, mounted on a roan horse, and wearing a
tabard of green and silver, rode a little ahead of his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin crouched low, watching them. He had no
doubt now as to whence these gentry had come and as
to what their business was. They were from Troy Castle,
adventurous rogues, the scum of the Yorkist armies, for
Roger Bland had good cause to keep a crowd of bullies
around him. He was no born lord; men had not served
his father before him; the fealty sworn to him was lip
service; he paid with gold for such faith as men would
sell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This bunch of spears came trotting across the grassland,
their horses’ hoofs beating the golden pollen from
the flowers. They reined in about a hundred paces from
the mere, and sat in a half circle, scanning the newly built
gate and the bridge, things that betrayed that Woodmere
was not deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz gave an order, and two men pricked away and
posted themselves at either end of the mere. The rest
dismounted; two who carried cross-bows wound up the
winches and stood with the bolts ready on the cord. One
of them marked down Martin on the tower, and calling
to Swartz, pointed out what he saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz rode nearer, staring upwards under his hand.
Nor did Martin play at hide-and-seek. The men had
seen him; the game had begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, there! Open, in the name of the King!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin kept silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! You on the tower, let the bridge down and
open the gate, or we shall have to break it for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was not to be drawn. His eyes kept watch while
his thought went racing through the woods toward
Mellis. Had she been taken? And even if they had not
taken her, her peril was still very desperate. She might
come riding out of the beech wood and betray herself to
these men. They were well mounted, and her old brown
horse would stand no chance in such a chase. He sweated
at the very thought of her being dragged down by this
rough pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz was still shouting, but his voice seemed a long
way off. Martin caught the words, but they had no more
significance than the scolding of a fish-wife. If he could
only get to Mellis, warn her! But the futility of such a
plan was self-apparent directly he considered it. If he
swam the mere he would have to swim it naked; he would
be seen, and either be killed or captured. No; salvation
did not lie that way. He remembered her charge to him,
“Keep good guard,” and the charge helped him to a
decision. It was his affair to keep these men out of Woodmere,
and to hold the place, if one man could hold it
against ten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz had given over shouting. He shook his fist at
the tower, and rode down boldly to examine the bridge.
There was no passage that way without much labor;
Swartz saw that plainly, and rode back again to his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was an old “free-lance,” and very determined.
He meant to enter Woodmere before sunset, or know
the reason why.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pounds and Littlejohn, you two men can swim. Off
with your harness and clothing; take poniards with you,
and see what is to be found over yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men looked glum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder, get to it, you dogs! Are you afraid of a girl
and a monk? You can run fast enough naked, if the monk
puts the fear of God into you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two fellows began to strip, and Martin saw how
the first assault threatened him. He had his bow and half
a dozen arrows with him, and there was no hesitation in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw the two men come haltingly toward the mere,
while their fellows roared jests at them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, but Jack Pounds has last year’s shirt on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yoicks, see Littlejohn mincing like a girl! More spunk,
Thomas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t frighten the lady, Jack! Be gentle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men waded into the shallows, and took the water
together, swimming side by side with their poniards between
their teeth. Martin had his chance and took it,
though he shot rather to discourage than to kill. The
arrow struck the water a yard from Littlejohn’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shouts went up from the gentry who were watching.
One of the cross-bowmen let fly, and the bolt struck the
stone coping behind which Martin was sheltering himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard Swartz cursing, and shaking his fist, for the
two swimmers had lost all stomach for so bald and naked
an adventure. They had turned back, and were splashing
toward the shallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz met them on the bank, and threatened them
with the flat of his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You craven swine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not loved because of his stern temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swim the foul pond yourself!” said one of them. “We
are not paid to be speared like fish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz’s blood was up and his ambition kindled. Roger
Bland did not grudge gold to those who served him well,
and Swartz saw that the luck was with him, and that he
might capture the prize before De Lisle or Rich could
come to share it. So he sat down before Woodmere, had
the horses taken back into the shade, and posted his two
cross-bowmen to mark the house. Swartz was an old
campaigner, and always carried a hatchet slung to his
saddle; it would serve in this crisis. He sent six of his
men into the woods to fell trees, while he himself rode his
horse at a walk around and around the mere, preferring
to trust his own eyes when a trap had to be watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin could have shot at him, but he respected Swartz’s
courage. These gentlemen were not to be scared away by
a few arrows; they were taking the business in hand with
methodical seriousness, and the outlook was not hopeful.
Yet Martin was conscious of a feeling of grim elation; his
wits were taut as a bow string; he had thrown himself
with a cool head and steady eyes into the great game of
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz’s purpose soon explained itself. The men came
down from the woods, carrying the trunks of young trees,
till they had a dozen or more, stacked ready at the end
of the causeway. They were going to throw a bridge
across the gap, batter the gate down, and take the place
by assault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin knelt on the leads of the tower, rubbing his
chin, and watching the menace taking shape. He was
thinking hard, how he could best meet the attack; whether
he should try to hold the gate against them, or make
his stand in the tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Happening to glance at the great beech wood, he saw
something that drove every other thought out of his head.
Mellis was there, looking down on the place from behind
the trunk of a beech tree. For a moment or two her white
face and green gown remained in view, and then vanished
into the wood’s gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin felt his heart beating hard under his ribs. He
looked at Swartz and the men. They were intent on the
work they had in hand; they had not seen Mellis.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXIII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant did some mighty rapid
thinking. That glimpse of Mellis’s face had
stirred his manhood to a kind of Norse frenzy.
Yet he kept his wits unclouded; and this was the way he
reasoned the thing out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will build that bridge of theirs. I might shoot
one or two of them through the loophole, but they have
cross-bows and will mark the loop. When they have built
their bridge they will be able to batter down the gate, and
while I am busy there, one or two of them might swim
the mere and come at me from behind. They are in light
harness. This armor of mine should turn a cross-bow bolt.
I will try to shoot one or two of them, and then open
the gate, let down my bridge, and give them battle there
or on the causeway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The audacity of the plan pleased him, for Martin
Valliant was discovering in himself the wit and daring of
a great fighter. He hung his green shield about his neck,
dropped the vizor of his salade, took the bow and arrows
and his naked sword, and made straight for the gate-house.
The ladder and stage he had built gave him command
of the loophole. And his luck and his cunning shook
hands, for he pinked two men, one in the body and the
other in the throat, before a cross-bow bolt came stinging
through the loophole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two from ten leaves eight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scrambled down the ladder, leaving his bow on
the stage, and quite calmly and at his leisure unbarred and
opened the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis, lying in a patch of young fern on the edge of
the beech wood, held her breath and watched him in
amazement. For one moment a wild doubt stabbed her;
he was a craven, he was going to surrender Woodmere and
shirk a fight. The next moment she thought him mad, but
she had torn all doubt of him from her heart and thrown
it from her with hot scorn. She saw Martin let down his
bridge, and take his stand just outside the gate, with the
point of his sword on the ground and his hands resting
on the pommel. He was a white and challenging figure
holding the bridge and the gate, daring Swartz and his
men to come at him and try their fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the cross-bowmen fired a shot; the bolt struck
Martin’s pauldron and glanced harmlessly aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drop that—drop that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz roared at the fellow. He was a tough old rogue,
but he had a soldier’s love of courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One man against eight, and you want to fight him at
fifty paces!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed his horse along the causeway, and looked
curiously at Martin Valliant. The figure in white harness
puzzled him; it did not seem to belong to a runaway
monk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are you, my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come and see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God—and we will! Bid that Dale wench drop her
bow, and my fellows shall not use their arbalists. We will
make a straight fight of it, Master Greenshield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first man to try his luck was a little stunted fellow
who had been a smith and was immensely strong in the
arms and back, but a fool in the choice of his weapons.
He came footing it cautiously along the narrow bridge,
with his spear held pointed at Martin. He had some idea
of feinting at Martin’s throat, of dropping the point and
getting the shaft between the taller man’s legs and tripping
him. The trick might have worked if Martin Valliant
had not lopped off the spear-head with a sudden sweep
of his sword, caught the staff in his left hand, and swung
the fellow into the water. The smith could not swim, and
was drowned; but Martin had no time to think of being
merciful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall fellow charged him while he was still on the
beam, and it was a question of which man gave the
bigger blow and knocked the other into the mere. Martin’s
sword had that honor. Swartz’s second gentleman fell
across the beam with a red wound in his throat, struggled
for a few seconds, and then slipped dying into the mere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz was biting his beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—there is no man here who can stand up to a
monk! Big Harry, there: have a swash at him with your
pole-ax.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big Harry had the face and temper of a bull. He made
a rush along the bridge, swung his pole-ax, and struck
at Martin’s head. The salade threw the point aside, and
the shaft struck Martin’s shoulder. He had shortened his
sword and thrust hard at the big man. The point went
through Big Harry’s midriff, and the mere hid a third
victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz rolled out of the saddle and drew his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand back! This fellow is too good for such raw
cattle. I have fought many fights in my time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Martin did a knightly thing. He went to meet
Swartz, crossing the beam, so that they met on the broad
causeway where neither man could claim any advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz saluted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take that to heart, my friend. It was gallantly thought
of. One word before we fight it out like gentlemen. Who
the devil are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin kept silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not tell me? I must find it out for myself.
Good. And so—to business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz was lightly armed, and he trusted to his swordsmanship,
for he was very clever with the sword. But his
swashbuckling craftiness proved useless against a man
harnessed as Martin Valliant was harnessed, and who
fought like a young madman. It was like aiming delicate
and cunning blows at a man of iron, a man who struck
back furiously without troubling to defend himself.
Swartz, with blood in his eyes, plunged to escape that
whistling sword, closed with Martin, and tried to throw
him; but Martin’s gadded fist beat him off and sent him
heavily to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz lay still, while the five men who had stood to
watch this battle royal fumbled with their weapons and
looked at each other out of the corners of their eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try the cross-bow on him, Jack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot, man, and we’ll push at him with our spears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin Valliant did not leave them the right to
choose how and when they would attack him. His blood
was on fire. He came leaping along the causeway, a white
figure of shining wrath, and those five men turned tail
and fled incontinently toward the woods. Martin did not
follow them, but went back to the place where Swartz
was lying. The old swashbuckler was sitting up, dazed,
ghastly, trying to wipe the blood out of his eyes with his
knuckles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in Martin leaped out to the man he had
wounded. This fellow with the black beard was made of
finer stuff than the lousels who had taken to their heels.
He grinned at Martin Valliant, and tried to rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, my friend; but am I also to feed the fishes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin helped him to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That blood must be staunched. Those rogues should
have stood and fought for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them run. Master Greenshield, methinks you have
broken my brain pan with that blow of yours. Let me lie
down on something soft. I feel sick as a dog that has
eaten grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin sheathed his sword, picked up Swartz in his
arms, and carried him over the footbridge. He remembered
his own bed of bracken at the foot of the stairs,
and he bore the wounded man there and laid him on
the fern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, Greenshield. My head’s full of molten metal.
No—let me lie. I’ll just curse and burrow into the fern,
I have had worse wounds than this in my time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stretched out a hand suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No bad blood—no grudges! I’m your prisoner; I play
fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gripped his hand hard and went back to the
gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had been lying in the bracken, listening to the
rout of Swartz’s gentry in the wood behind her. For five
men they made a fine noise and flutter in getting to horse,
and it was like the flight of a small army, what with their
shouting and their quarreling as to what should be done.
She heard them galloping away into the Forest, for they
were in frank agreement upon the main issue, and that
was to have nothing more to do with that devil of a man
in white harness who held the bridge at Woodmere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis rose up, and went down toward the mere, her
heart full of Martin’s victory. He came out through the
gate as she reached the causeway and crossed the footbridge
to meet her. He had taken off his salade, and so
came to her bare-headed, flushed, brave-eyed, and triumphant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheen of her eyes opened the gates of heaven. She
was exultant, glorious, a woman whose love had taken fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant—oh, brave heart! What a fight was
that! I thought you mad when you came out on the
bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could find nothing to say to her, but his eyes gave
her an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little thought that I was watching you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This made him smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I knew that you were up yonder. I saw you looking
down from behind a tree. I think I could have beaten
twenty men—because you were watching me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I so fierce?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it is not that,” he said, quite simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis knew what was in his heart, and the cry that
echoed to it in her own. She looked at him with a sudden,
tremulous light in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have a man brave and staunch—for my sake.
It is very sweet to a woman when she is lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin dared not look at her for a moment. He was
her man so utterly that he could have kissed the dust
from her feet, for the love in him was great and passionate
and holy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did what my heart bade me,” he said, “and not to
shame this sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, give me the sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all bloody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What matter. It is but a christening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew the sword from its scabbard and gave it into
her hands. And Mellis kissed the cross of the hilt, and
held it for him to take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a second sacrament,” he said; “I shall need no
other crucifix.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered Woodmere, and Martin raised the bridge
and closed the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You took a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remembered Swartz, brain-sick and groaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Their captain! A good fighter—and a generous. I must
wash his wound; and if I could find linen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have linen. I love that softness in you,
comrade; good soldiers are made so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned aside through the postern into the garden,
and Martin went to look at Swartz. He was sitting up,
holding his head between his hands, but the blood had
ceased flowing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Brother Greenshield, get me out into the sunlight.
I would rather lie on the green grass—under those
apple trees. This place smells of the coffin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin helped him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wound of yours must be dressed. Mistress Mellis
is finding me linen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz put an arm around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deo gratias, but I guess I owe this crack of the poll to
her. Well, I bear her no ill-will. And I have a liking for
you, Greenshield, a man after my own heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were trying to kill each other half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, man, are we the worse for that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin helped Swartz out into the orchard and propped
him against a tree. And there Mellis found them like
brethren in arms when she brought linen and red wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found you linen, Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not tell him that she had torn it from
her own shift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz had a look at her as she turned to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saints, brother, but some things are well lost for a
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes grew grim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush, man, I did not speak lightly. Never flare out at
Peter Swartz; he is too old a ruffian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin fetched water from the mere in his salade and
washed and dressed Swartz’s head for him. He gave him
wine to drink, and Swartz was glad of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Zounds, that’s good. Now, by my soul, I think I will
spend the night here, out of the dew, and with the stars
blinking above. I have a love of the green earth, Martin
Valliant; I was not bred in a city. And look you here,
man——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gazed at him steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You took me in fair fight, and here I shall stay, so
long as you hold the place. I swear to keep faith, and to
play no tricks on you. And here’s the hand of a soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin accepted the pledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart trusts you,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One word, lad: never trust the man I serve—or did
serve—Roger Bland, if you have him as you have me now.
I am a war-dog, but he is a cold snake. Put your heel on
his head, and spare no weight.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXIV</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The sun sank low in the west, and the whole world
was very still. Peter Swartz had fallen asleep under
his apple tree in the orchard, and the white blossom
scattered itself on him as he slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great wonder had overtaken Martin Valliant. He
had eased himself of his harness and gone down to a little
grassy place where willows cast a net of shadows over
the brown water. He stood there, leaning against the trunk
of a willow tree, listening to the birds singing in the
valley that shone like a great bowl of magic gold. The
west was all afire, and throwing a strange glory over the
woods, so that the tall trees seemed topped with flame.
Not a breath of wind stirred in the leaves or grasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Martin Valliant’s heart was full of a strange,
listening awe. He looked at the still water, the burning
trees, the glimmering meadows, and there seemed no
sadness anywhere, but only deep exultation and a sob of
wonder in the throat. His face shone under the soft
green of the willows. This place was the new Paradise,
and a woman’s eyes looked out of the window of Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice called to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A spasm of emotion shook Martin Valliant’s soul. He
spread his arms, and raised his face to the sunset. If to
love a woman was sin, then God was a devil, and the
Lord Christ had never walked the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard Mellis come singing through the orchard
where Peter Swartz slept under the apple trees. The
sound of her voice quickened his love almost to anguish.
He dared not go to her for the moment or meet those
dark eyes of hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came out from the shadows of the orchard, and
saw him standing there, his right arm covering his face.
Her heart faltered for a beat or two, and then quickened
with a rush of wonder and awe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis went toward him, her eyes mysterious and full
of soft, tremulous light. Martin heard her footsteps and
her gown sweeping the grass. He uncovered his face, and
it was all white and strange and radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment they looked at each other with mute
timidity. There seemed nothing that could be said, for
the great mystery of life had touched them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mellis spoke, and her words were no louder than
a light wind moving in the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know what the day has done to me. But I
could sit in the long grass and listen to the birds singing,
and watch the sunset on the water, and never speak nor
move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very wonderful,” he said, “for all the joy of the
world seems in this valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could touch no food to-night but honey and white
bread, and moisten my lips with the dew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard Martin draw in his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And presently the soft dusk will come, and the day
will die. But there will be the stars, and a silver sheen on
the water, and a silence that waits—and listens——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face dreamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed her, found himself at her side, moving
through the long grass that rustled under their feet. He
was no more a body, but a soul that burned with yearning
and a great white glory. And Mellis’s hair was as black
as the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led him into the garden, and there he saw their
table strewn with flowers. She had set out bread, and
wine, and honey. His helmet lay in the midst on a cushion
of green leaves, and she had bound it about with a spray
of red roses taken from the old rose bush.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis pointed a finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even the roses bloomed for us to-day. And there is
your crown of victory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stretched out a hand and touched hers timidly, as
though he were afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand closed on his with a sudden thrill of tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not life good? Do you fear to look at me, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have stepped out of heaven,” he said, “and the
great light of you blinds my eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat down at the board, but though the bread was
white and the honey sweet, little of either passed their
lips. It fell to old Swartz to make an end of the loaf, and
to sweeten his black beard with the honey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Deo gratias,” he said when Martin brought him his
supper; “but I have been asleep and dreaming, and in
my dreams I thought I heard a woman singing. You can
leave me the wine bottle. I shall not play the swine with
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked shrewdly at Martin Valliant’s face, and saw
that the green island had become a place of enchantment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get you gone, Sir Greenshield. I shall be ready to
sleep again, and this apple tree will serve as a tent. Black
beards are not for such as you, and perhaps I was not
dreaming when I slept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cut himself a great hunch of bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think of the blood I have to make good! Take your
youth, man, and thank God for it. You are welcome to
any glory you have got out of the bloodying of my poll!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz watched Martin Valliant walk back toward the
garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His head is in Paradise,” he said to himself, “but he
had the heart to remember my supper. May the wench
be kind to him. It is all a midsummer madness—this love.
Well, give me the madness, say I; good wine and a
comely woman. The worms can have me when a wench
will no longer give me a glint of the eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had brought her lute with her from the Black
Moor, and she had not touched its strings since she had
sung to the burgher revelers in the tavern at Gawdy
Town. And somehow all her grief and travail and yearning
seemed to melt into an exultation that was like the
beauty of an April day, a race of sunlight and of shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the sunset reddened, and the black bats began to
flutter around on noiseless wings, the sound of her lute
went over the water. Old Swartz heard it, and then her
voice, deep, and strange, and very sweet, warming the
heart like wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked down at Martin lying in the grass at her
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there sin in my singing—when my brother is dead?
Am I forgetting because my mouth is not silent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunset lit up Martin’s face. His eyes were gazing
into the distance, eyes that questioned the earth and
heaven—and life and the hypocrisies of men. It was as
though the gates of a new wisdom had been opened to
him. A man may think himself into hell, and feel himself
into heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is sin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such words from your lips!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see a vision,” he said slowly, “of the beauty of the
earth and the mystery thereof. Shall I quarrel with the
apple because it comes from the bloom of the tree? Do
not the beasts fight for their mates, and is there not a
nobleness in valor? The good knight rides out, and his
strength is for the service of those who are oppressed. As
for hiding in a cell and starving one’s body—such a life
begins to smell of cowardice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her head proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are rebels, Master Valliant, you and I. Say, have
I lost you your soul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, by God; but you have found it for me, and set
it free. I am no longer afraid of the shadows of sick
thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swept her fingers over the strings, and began to
sing to him as the dusk gathered. The woods melted into
a cloud of blackness; the red of the sky changed to amber;
moths came to feed from the white flowers in the
grasses of the wild garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Between the snatches of song she leaned toward him,
and he knelt to meet her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if we die to-morrow? What can the Lord of
Troy take from us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No man shall take you while I live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in the Forest the birds sing at dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in the night I lie before your door to guard it
with my body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They looked long into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant,” she said very softly, “Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he bowed himself and kissed her feet.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXV</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer of Badger Hill was too shrewd a
gentleman to betray himself or his affairs to the
lurkers whom John Rich had left in the woods to
watch him. Falconer made no stir about the place, left
his men working in the fields, and kept his own counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the dogs have been busy about here,” he said to
himself, “we will give them no cause to hunt us. There
are other parts of the Forest where men can muster and
march to help Mellis Dale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he was much troubled about Mellis, and what
might have happened at Woodmere in her absence.
Roger Bland’s men might have seized the place and
made it a trap for her. John Falconer had no faith in any
runaway monk, even though he happened to be old
Valliant’s son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When night came he went quietly to the stable with
a wallet full of food, saddled and bridled his horse, and
rode out by the way of the pine woods. The moon would
not be up for an hour; the woods were dark as a pit; he
saw nothing of Rich’s men, nor did they see anything of
him. When he was well away from Badger Hill, John
Falconer tied up his horse and sat down to wait for the
moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old forester though he was, Falconer missed his way
that night, and the sun had been up an hour before he
reached the hills above Woodmere Vale. Martin Valliant
had been up and stirring before the dawn, for love and
his harness had left him but little sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had taken the watch, and had bidden him unbuckle
his harness and sleep in the upper room; but
Martin had refused to take off his breast and back-plates,
gorget and cuishes, lest Roger Bland’s men should try to
steal into the place at night and catch him unprepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When your friends rally here,” he had said, “then I
can rest out of this iron skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was minded to better his footbridge, and broaden
it with two lighter pieces of planking so that a horse could
be brought across. His forethought proved prophetic, for
when the first grayness of the dawn spread over the valley
he saw three horses quietly cropping the grass not fifty
yards from the bridge-head. One of them was Swartz’s
roan; the others had been lost by the five men in the
flurry of their flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz’s roan seemed to be a companionable beast. He
came down to the bridge-head, and stood there whinnying
and watching Martin at his work. He was still saddled
and bridled, as were his two comrades who went on
cropping the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant looked at Swartz’s horse as he had
never looked at a horse before. The creature had a new
meaning for him; it was no ambling pad, no fat palfrey,
but a beast built to carry a man to battle, one of the
strong things of the earth whose strength had to be
mastered. Martin left his bridge-building for something
more knightly. He wanted to ride Swartz’s horse, to feel
himself astride of that brown body, to know himself the
creature’s master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roan seemed as ready as Martin Valliant. He was
playful, full of zest, and went off at a canter directly
Martin was in the saddle. But the man was the lord. He
made the beast drop to a trot, and then worked him to
a gallop over the dew-wet grasslands between the water
and the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So when John Falconer came to the edge of the beech
wood he saw a young man in half armor galloping a horse
furiously up and down the valley, and handling him like
no novice. Horse and man were in excellent temper, the
one delighting in riding, the other in being ridden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer kept himself in the shade, and looked
down on Woodmere. He noticed the two horses feeding
by the mere, that the bridge was down and the gate open,
and for the moment he had good cause to fear that the
Lord of Troy’s men had taken the place, and that this
galloper on the horse was one of them. Then he saw a
woman appear on the leads of the tower, and knew her
to be Mellis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched Martin Valliant and the roan horse, and
waved a hand to him as he came cantering back from
the lower end of the valley. Falconer tugged at his beard
with thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is our outlaw monk! The fellow has learned
to sit a horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode out from the beech wood, and the two horses
converged upon the bridge, Martin feeling for his sword
and calling himself a fool for galloping about unarmed,
with the bridge down and the gate open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Mellis waving a scarf at the new-comer, and
guessed that all was well. Falconer had reined in by the
bridge-head and was waiting for the man on the roan
horse. The master of Badger Hill had a shrewd eye for
the shape of a man, the color of his eyes, and the set of
his head. He could look inwards, judge without favor;
and though he had no desire to be pleased, Martin Valliant
pleased him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two men stared into each other’s eyes with a
certain searching and haughty curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is Roger Valliant’s son? You are overtrustful,
young man, to go galloping up and down with that gate
open. Had I been an enemy, I could have put a shaft into
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin flushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have called myself a fool for it,” he said bluntly,
“but the horse came and whinnied at me, and I had to
ride him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it is no horse of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Peter Swartz’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peter Swartz’s! Such a tale hangs crooked!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is wounded and a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mellis came out to them with eyes that smiled
at old Falconer’s grim and puzzled face. He had to be
told everything, how Martin had fought with Peter
Swartz and his men, beaten them, and taken Swartz
prisoner. And still John Falconer was not pleased. He
had ridden out with a fixed distrust of Martin Valliant in
his heart, and being an obstinate and dogged gentleman,
he was in no hurry to surrender his distrust. Martin had
tied up Swartz’s horse and gone back to his bridge-building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very pretty—very pretty. But the fat’s in the fire,
thanks to our champion’s valor. ’Twould have been almost
better to have played fox and let them have the
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what would you have said of Martin Valliant if
he had made no fight for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Praised his cunning, no doubt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you would have called him a coward and a
traitor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was smiling, but there was a glitter of hot partisanship
in her eyes, and she was ready to stand by her man
and speak for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is not like you, John Falconer, to quibble and
sneer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mistress, when our heads depend on the adventure,
our wits are apt to fly out hot-temperedly. Nor am I
pleased that we should owe yonder fellow a service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then men are less generous than women. Why, I
owe life and more to that man; I have taken his vows
from him, made of him a murderer in the eyes of the
law. Before he saw me—before I blundered into his life—he
was God’s man, with nothing to fear in the whole
world. To-morrow he might hang, because the blood in
him was generous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer looked like an old dog who was trying to
take his scolding without a blink of the eyes. He knew
that Mellis was in the right, and that it was his own heart
that grudged Martin her gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well, he will either hang or be knighted. Nor
have we any leisure to stand arguing here. I could bring
no men with me, for my place is watched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roger Bland is wise by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the devil of it. We must get a garrison for
Woodmere as soon as we may. Young Blount can call
two or three score fellows together with good speed.
You and I had better ride at once to Bloody Rood. Your
face will count with young Nigel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a shrewd look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And trust Woodmere to Martin Valliant? He is not
so poor a comrade, after all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spoke hastily. The lad has brave eyes. We can trust
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin Valliant was left to hold Woodmere, while
Mellis mounted her horse and rode with John Falconer
to Bloody Rood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men called young Blount “Sir Nigel Head-in-air.” He
was a dark, hawk-faced stripling, very passionate and
headstrong, vain, quarrelsome, the fool of any woman
who could use her eyes. John Falconer would never have
chosen such a fellow as a comrade, but the Blounts had
a strong following and had to be considered. Moreover,
young Nigel would be ready to gallop on any wild adventure;
he had impudence and courage and a sense of his
own splendor. Men were wanted at Woodmere. Nigel
Blount could be packed off with Mellis to temper his
recklessness, while he, John Falconer, went about to raise
the Forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning proved propitious. They found Sir Nigel
in the midst of his hounds and his men, ready to start
out after a fine hart that had been spotted by his trackers.
He was mounted on a black Arab, and his colors were
crimson and green. He looked sulky when he saw John
Falconer, but Mellis’s face put him in a different humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good day’s hunting spoiled, lording!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And well spoiled in such a service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was ready to tumble into his harness and ride out
as Mellis’s champion almost before John Falconer had
said all he had to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but a scurvy hedge priest left at Woodmere!
Heart of Heaven, but that shall be altered. Leave Woodmere
to me, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hounds were sent back to the kennels. Young
Blount had jacks and steel caps for some of his men, and
a score or so bills and boar spears. The men took their
bows with them. He mustered eighteen followers, a force
that was strong enough to hold Woodmere till the Forest
rose in arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer took Mellis aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch that young jay. He screams too much. Remember
to make him obey you. It should be easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew how to queen it over young firebrands like
Nigel Blount.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall rule him, John, with one finger. And now,
good-by. Woodmere waits for us.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXVI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Five men rode up to the gate of Troy Castle just as
the sun was setting in a flare of yellow behind the
black towers. These five gentlemen were a little
ashamed of themselves, and had dressed up a tale between
them to show to the Lord of Troy. Peter Swartz was dead
and could not kick their scarecrow to pieces. That devil of
a fellow in white harness bulked bigger and bigger in the
romance, cutting men in two with one sweep of the
sword, and tossing Swartz like a puppy dog into the
moat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have run, gossips, and there must be a reason for
it, or we shall be damned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their unanimity was admirable. My Lord of Troy
owed them six months’ pay, a shrewd way he had of
keeping men at his heels, but he did not concern himself
with cowards. These five dogs knew better than to run
home with their tails between their legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland was at supper, a noble function in which
all stateliness was properly and finely considered. He had
a love of taking his meals in public, of playing at pageantry
even among the plates. His wealth showed itself in his
gold cups and dishes, his tapestries and dorsers, his linen
and silver, the musicians, their coats of blue and green,
his crowd of serving men, the profusion of food. All this
peacocking had a purpose. Men’s senses are conquered
and led into subjection by the pomps that paint a picture
of power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle had returned and brought in the bodies
of Vance and the archer. Rich and his men were back
from Badger Hill. Neither of these captains had caught
much; the Forest did not lightly surrender its secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile those five fugitive worthies had chosen a
player and spokesman, a little Welshman with much
language and fiery eyes. He was to tell their tale of the
attack on Woodmere to Roger Bland, and dress up a few
picturesque lies to give the tale a greater appearance of
reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of their coming was brought to my Lord of
Troy as he sat at the high table. The page who brought
the news had been listening to the Welshman filling the
guard-room with sound and fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These fellows say, my lord, that Swartz is dead, and
five more with him, and that they were beaten by one
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My lord was cracking nuts, and picking them out of
their shells with precise indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who are the men, Ralph?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was De Lisle who asked the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morgan the Welshman, Part, and Simonsby, and fat
Horner, and one more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Lisle laughed, and nodded at Roger Bland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could have named the men, my lord; spunkless
rogues all of them. Morgan would lie the hoofs off Satan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord of Troy went on cracking nuts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ralph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring the men in here, all of them, and let them line
up in front of my table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was obeyed. The five bold “blades” found themselves
standing in a row, while Roger Bland ate his nuts,
and looked at them as though they were cattle to be
judged. He did not speak, and the five tried not to fidget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Question these fellows for me, Sir Fulk de Lisle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord, with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Fulk de Lisle thrust the bright blade of truth into
the belly of their invention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you ran away, my friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They denied it, Morgan the Welshman leading the
chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, how is it that you are here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland smiled like a cynical old priest listening
to a confession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very presentable question, sir. Let me amplify it.
You found people at Woodmere, Morgan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Welshman tried to get his imagination into its
stride, but my lord would not let him gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw no more than one man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A giant, sir, a devil of a fellow in white harness, plated
from poll to toes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, a paladin! You say that he killed Swartz and
five more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was like an iron bull, my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so you ran away! Yes, yes—I have no patience to
waste, fool, on your paltry lies. You saw nothing of a
woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Out with you—out of my sight! Master
Rich, come here to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five slouched out, and John Rich, who was sitting
at the far end of the dais table, came and stood behind
Roger Bland’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Master Rich, bend your head nearer. You will
take thirty men and such gear as you need, and ride at
dawn. I must have this fabulous fellow in white harness.
See to it that he does not frighten you all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rich grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be done, my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, let it be done. I am beginning to be angry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes later my Lord of Troy took a last sip of
sweet wine, washed his hands in perfumed water, and
went to his closet. Fulk de Lisle followed at his heels,
smiling humorously at the great man’s back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fulk de Lisle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear lord?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there more in this, think you, than meets the eye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The slaying of Vance, sir, was very natural, and I
take it that Swartz fell by the same hand. This bastard
priest is something of an enigma. How did he come by
armor and a sword? Such things do not grow in the
Forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland’s pale eyelids seemed to flicker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must see the end and bottom of this affair. I
have given John Rich the adventure; I give you John
Rich. Is that plain to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most plain, my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See that this business is carried through. I want the
Forest’s secret—if it is keeping a secret. I care not how it
is come by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a spacious way, my lord, of sending a gentleman
upon your business. We are not cramped and
hindered by little abominations of the law. It is an honor
to serve you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he went out with the air of a man who knew
himself to be shrewder than his master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the preparations that were maturing at
Troy Castle on the night after Martin Valliant’s defeat of
Swartz and his men. John Rich took the road next morning,
while Martin was improving his footbridge, and
Mellis was chastening the hot vanities of young Nigel
Blount. Martin had brought the three horses over the
mere, stabled them in the old dining hall, pulled up the
bridge and shut the gate. He took life with great seriousness,
but his heart was full of a new song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was shaping a new oak bar for the garden
postern when Peter Swartz came out of the orchard for a
gossip. He had slept passably and eaten better, though his
legs were none too steady under him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He squatted on the grass, and watched Martin with a
friendly glint in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My noddle still simmers like a boiling pot. What
happens to-day, brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What God wills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz looked at him intently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine philosophy, Martin Valliant, but God may leave
a man with a noose about his neck. You would say that
this is no affair of mine, nor is it, save that I have no lust
for a man’s blood, or to see him kicking at the end of a
rope. The Forest would be healthier than this sweet
island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stood idle, the bill hanging in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here to serve,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend, you have drunk of the magic cup. A man
might wound you, and you would hardly feel it. But my
Lord of Troy is no child of dreams. You are but a rat—to
be sniffed out by terriers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder—that’s where the trouble lies. This child
with the eyes of midnight wonder——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his fist at Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No frowns, no haughtiness, good comrade. Is she too
miraculous to be spoken of by my lips? Why, by all the
devils, have I no heart in me, and no liking for the gallant
splendor of youth? You will be attacked to-day, not with
ten men, but with fifty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin answered him bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has gone for help. We are not alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared down at Swartz, and Swartz’s eyes met his
without flinching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So—that is the game! I guessed it. There is the color
of a red rose in all this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guess what you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Richmond—a Richmond! The Forest is stirring with
the wind, eh? And I am Peter Noside for the moment.
Yes, and let me tell you one thing, Martin Valliant, your
friends will need to hurry if they are to make this place
good. There are cannon at Raychester. Oh, this great
and happy madness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose up, and walked to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an old fool I am, but I could change sides to
get a blow at my dear master. Why must some of us
always rush to help the man who has his back against the
wall? Hallo—hallo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shrill and clear came the scream of a trumpet from
the valley. Martin Valliant and Peter Swartz stood looking
at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Troy, by God! And a summons. What did I tell you,
comrade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin dropped the billhook and took his sword, that
was leaning against the wall. He stared hard at Swartz,
as though to read the man’s soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz smiled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I shall not stab you in the back, man; have no
fear. Let us go up on the tower and look at the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed Martin to the leads, but did not show himself
above the wall. Martin was scanning the valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you see, brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man on a white horse with a green banner, and on
it a silver key. There is another man with a trumpet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Troy. What else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A knight in black harness, on a black horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be John Rich. Nothing more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a shining of something, back in the beech
wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steel, man, steel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trumpeter blew a second blast, and John Rich and
his banner-bearer rode down nearer to the water. They
were scanning the island, and had sighted Martin on the
tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A summons, Greenshield.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing to say to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then say nothing. They will take to other music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz, raising his head to look, saw John Rich turn
his horse and ride back slowly to the beech wood, followed
by his trumpeter and the man who carried my
Lord of Troy’s banner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, the old fox! John Rich takes his time. You will
not see until you do see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour passed, and nothing happened. The beech
wood looked black, mysterious, and inscrutable, while
Martin stood to arms upon the tower, feeling that the
wood above was full of eyes that watched and waited.
Swartz had grown restless. His heart was taking sides in
the adventure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the old fox at? I mislike this silence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly he heard Martin Valliant give a strange,
sharp cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood rigid, his eyes shining like glass in the sunlight,
his forehead all knotted up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz looked over the battlements, and uttered a
robust and honest oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What damnable fool is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away down the valley young Nigel Blount and Mellis
had ridden out from the woods and were crossing the
open grassland toward the mere, with Nigel’s men
straggling as they pleased half a furlong behind them.
Young Blount was riding gallantly enough, making his
horse cut capers, while he showed what manner of man
he was in the saddle. His men were laughing and talking,
their bows unstrung, not one of them troubling to
keep watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peacock! Ape! Shout, man, shout! There is a trap
set here, if I am not much mistaken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin raised his sword, and flashed it to and fro. He
saw Mellis draw rein, and knew that her eyes were on
him. He pointed toward the beech wood, but even if
she understood his warning it came too late.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXVII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The beech wood filled with sudden movement, and
its blackness was like a storm cloud sending out a
vague and hollow muttering. Dark shapes came
hurrying out of the gloom beyond the gray trunks, the
shapes of men and horses that took on color, fierceness,
life. There was the rattle of harness, the flashing of steel.
John Rich and his riders came out at the gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A piece of tapestry seemed unrolled, so swiftly did
things happen. The very power of movement was taken
away from Martin Valliant. He saw all that passed as
though it were in a dream, the black figure of John
Rich and his horse going at the gallop with spear leveled,
the men behind him strung out in a half circle and all
rushing like the wind. There was Mellis’s white face,
helpless, hesitating, like a piece of apple blossom floating
on the blackness of a pool. Young Nigel Blount, sword
in air, was shouting to his men, who had turned tail and
were running for the shelter of the woods. Then Rich’s
spear smote right through Nigel Blount’s body. Martin
heard the lad’s scream, saw him twist like a puppet on a
wire, and tumble backwards, dragging the point of Rich’s
spear to the ground. The riders swept around Mellis; she
seemed to sink out of sight in the thick of the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant awoke. He uttered a great cry, and
rushed toward the little turret where the stairway opened
upon the leads. As he reached it Peter Swartz caught him
by the sword belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay, you fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin tried to thrust him off, but Swartz kept his
hold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, my friend, knock my teeth out if it pleases
you, but if your head’s on fire mine had better do the
thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And see you rush out there and be ridden down and
spitted like that poor popinjay! Thirty to one are heavy
odds, Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let go, curse you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And hold on, say I. Listen to reason, man, and use
your wits. You’ll not help that girl by getting yourself
killed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The strength of God is in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the brains of a sheep! The game is not lost and
won yet, but it will be if you go rushing out like a mad
bull. Cunning, man—cunning and patience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stood irresolute, his eyes full of wrath and
yearning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I must die, I’ll die now, Swartz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, good fool, set your teeth and bide your time! It
is no time for dying. What use would a dead man be to
the child out yonder? Set your teeth, Martin Valliant;
play the grim dog who can watch and wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid his arm across Martin’s shoulders and drew
him aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, man, I’m with you, and you will thank me to-morrow
for this. And here are we squabbling and scuffling
when we should be watching like hawks. Come—we
must match John Rich for cunning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant surrendered, but he covered his face
with his sword-arm and stood shaking like a man with
the ague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile John Rich was riding back at his leisure,
the bridle of Mellis’s horse over his wrist. Ten of his
men had gone in pursuit of the foresters from Bloody
Rood, and two more had dismounted, taken young
Blount’s body by the heels, and were dragging it down
to the mere. John Rich brought his horse close to the
bridge-head, and his trumpeter blew a summons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A parley, Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin straightened himself, with a sudden shining of
the eyes. He saw Mellis sitting her horse beside John
Rich, pale, motionless, tragically calm. She looked up
toward the tower, and Martin fancied that she smiled;
he felt that his heart would break for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they would take me and let her go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz scoffed at his madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord of Troy is no honey-pot, to catch flies and
let them escape as they please. Have nothing to say to
John Rich; let him blow his trumpet till the fellow’s
cheeks burst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stood forward, resting his hands on the pommel
of his sword. John Rich hailed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, there! Come down and open the gate. The
game is played out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant’s eyes were fixed on Mellis’s face. He
was wondering whether she despised him for not rushing
out to strike a blow for her—whether she thought him a
coward. Swartz had crouched down behind the wall, and
was watching Martin narrowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, brother. That child has brave eyes and a fine
heart. She will understand. Tell Rich to go to the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stood like a statue, and Rich bellowed again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have done with this fooling. Will you give us the
place, or are we to take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was waiting for something, and that something
came. He saw Mellis raise her head proudly; he saw her
mouth open; her voice reached out to him across the
water:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand fast, Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised the cross of his sword and kissed it as a sign
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the death!” he called to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And John Rich, accepting the defiance, turned his
horse and rode back with Mellis to the beech wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now John Rich was a man of method. He posted a
guard of ten men to cover the bridge, and two more to
patrol the banks of the mere. The rest disappeared into
the woods, shed their harness, and took to ax and saw, for
John Rich had brought a tumbril laden with ropes, a
ladder, tools, balks of timber, and such-like gear from
Troy Castle. The matter was to be undertaken stolidly
and with thoroughness. He set his men at building a
couple of rafts or floats that could be dragged down to
the mere after dark. Half his party would pole themselves
over to attack the house, while the rest held the
causeway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin kept watch upon the tower, and Swartz remained
with him out of a new-born spirit of comradeship.
A great restlessness tormented Martin Valliant. He
could no longer see his love, nor guess what might have
befallen her, and his soul suffered in a lover’s purgatory.
All the past years had been blotted out; he had lived just
seven days since this woman had come into his life, with
those eyes of hers dark as the forest and her lips red as
the rose. Great storms of tenderness and wrath swept
through him. He was tortured by vivid memories of her,
flashes of her that hurt his soul, the miraculous way her
dark eyes would fill with golden lights, her plaintive look
when she was sad, the little dimple in her cheek, the way
her lips moved, the shape of her fingers, the curve of her
chin, the falling of her dark hair over her ears. These
vivid flashes of her intoxicated, maddened him. He wanted
to pour himself out, die for her, spend his great love, and
make her feel it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz watched Martin closely as he went restlessly to
and fro, or stood and stared at the beech wood as though
it held both heaven and hell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin turned on him with furious eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience! Man, man, I burn—I burn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your torch alight; there is no harm in it. With
the night will come your hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Things may be done by a desperate man at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True. I can swim the moat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood and brooded with a face that spelled death for
some one. His love and his helplessness scorched him like
flame. He could have choked Swartz for telling him to
wait, though in his heart he knew that Swartz was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes he would start, fancying that he had heard
Mellis calling to him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would turn on Swartz:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, my son—nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz was laconic, implacable. He had made himself
a little peephole by loosening some of the stones with
his dagger and levering them out. This squint of his commanded
the beech wood, and he watched it like a dog
waiting for a rat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thunder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin turned and saw him kneeling with his eye close
to the hole. His lips were stretched tight over his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you behind me, man? What do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin faced sharply toward the beech wood. A man
had ridden out from the shade—a man in a red doublet
slashed and puffed with blue, a red hat on his head, his
legs and thighs cased in white armor. He was a very
tall man, and he sat his horse with a certain swaggering
grace. In his right hand he carried a light switch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz spat hate at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell hound, swaggerer, bully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen that fellow before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I have seen him too often. What, you have lived
in these parts and know not Messire Fulk de Lisle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s forehead wrinkled itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fulk de Lisle! A great gentleman in my Lord of
Troy’s service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great gentleman! God help you, Martin Valliant,
and God help— Enough. This clinches it. I have often
itched to cut that man’s throat, though I have served
with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant’s eyes filled with a sudden fury of
understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is he here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To play any devil’s trick that pleases him. You do
not know Messire Fulk de Lisle. Rich is a saint beside
him. The debonair, filthy, malicious devil! Why, I could
tell you— Oh! to hell with the beast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He twisted around and looked up into Martin Valliant’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, can you stand torture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing he brings the child—and tries to break you
by—shaming her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s face was like a white flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! It’s beyond belief! Why should he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz grimaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he is Fulk de Lisle; because he has a foul
cleverness and a liking for such things. My Lord of Troy
would laugh at such a comedy. God and the Saints, I
wonder now why I have lived with such men!”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXVIII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis lay in a patch of young bracken in a little
glade among the beech trees. They had tied her
feet together, but left her hands free, after searching
her and taking away her poniard. Five paces away a
man stood on guard—a man with the beard of a goat
and stupid eyes hard as gray stones out of a brook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis lay very still, the fronds of the fern arching over
her and throwing little flecks of shadow on her face. But
though her bosom hardly betrayed her breathing, and her
hands lay motionless among the bracken stems, all that
was quick and vital in her lived in her eyes. The pupils
were big and black and sensitive with fear, wild, tremulous
eyes in a white and anguished face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a great fear gripped her—the nameless, instinctive
fear of the wild creature caught in a trap, where struggling
is of no avail. She waited, listened, counted the
beats of her own heart, closed her eyes at times so that
she might not see the imbecile face of the man who
guarded her. But even a moment’s blindness quickened
her fear, her quivering dread of what might happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was snared, helpless, and felt a great hand ready
to close over her. The violence of young Nigel’s death
had shocked her horribly. She could not get the vision
of the poor fool out of her head; he was still screaming
and writhing on Rich’s spear. The patches of blue sky
between the trees seemed hard as steel; there was no
softness in the sunlight on the bracken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mouthed his name, but without sound. Her fingers
quivered; she drew her breath with a deep, pleading misery.
Her hands and her soul reached out to him; he
seemed the one strong and loyal thing left her in the
beginnings of her despair. For her despair was very real
and no piece of cowardice; she had no illusions as to the
temper of the men who served the Lord of Troy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not death she feared so much as that other—nameless
thing. She was herself as yet, clean, pure, virginal,
and a man loved her. And even as her love reached
out to him she clung with passionate, hoarding tenderness
to her own chastity. It was hers—and it was his. She
wanted it because he was what he was—her man, her
life’s mate. Such exaltations, such dear prejudices rise
from the sacred deeps of the heart. Without them flesh is
but flesh, and love mere gluttony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hours seemed to pass. The man who guarded her
yawned, spat in the bracken, and slouched around like
a tired cur. Sometimes Mellis found him staring at her
with a hungry, gloating glint in his eyes, a look for which
she loathed him as she would have loathed some slimy
thing that had touched her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she heard voices in the beech wood, voices
that seemed on the edge of a quarrel. They came nearer,
like two birds sparring and scolding at each other; one
was gay and insolent and swift, the other sullen and toneless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have your way, then! Damnation, such drolleries are
not part of my harness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too gentle, good John Rich. What is life but
a great hunting? And a plain, straight-forward gallop does
not always please me. There is no wit, no cunning in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No devilry, you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have it that way. I like my wine well spiced, and a
new spice tickles the palate. You dullards are content with
rivers of beer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the goat’s beard brisked up and stood
stiffly on guard as Fulk de Lisle and John Rich came out
from under the shade of the trees. Rich hung back, seeming
to have no stomach for Fulk de Lisle’s spiced devilries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand away, Bannister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard saluted with his sword, and slunk off under
the beeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis sat up. Fulk de Lisle was standing within two
paces of her, his hands on his hips, his red hat with its
plume clapped on his head like a halo. His brown eyes
stared at her boldly, and his red lips seemed on the point
of smiling. She hated the man instantly, hated because
she feared him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is the gentlewoman who turns quiet priests
into turbulent traitors! Mistress Dale, is not the thing
heavy on your conscience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His bantering air made her shiver, for it was like the
gliding of a snake through the fern. She did not answer
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my chastity, I feel sorry for that young man. For
three days to eat of the forbidden fruit, and then——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched the hot blood stain her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly it is a case for a rescue. Being a faithful son
of the Church, I must take it upon myself to deliver the
young man from this enchantment, that his eyes may be
opened before some good Christian hangs him. How does
it feel, madam, to have made a man a murderer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To John Rich her eyes would have cried, “Have pity,”
but Fulk de Lisle saw no more than a handsome wench
whose pride struggled with her fear. Her pride won the
victory. She remained mute before him, with a white stillness
that refused to unbend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle’s brown eyes were smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam is sullen; she does not repent. Humility is good
in a woman. It seems then that I must play the father to
this poor fool of a monk; there are many ways of opening
a man’s eyes. Supposing, Mistress Dale, you were given
the chance of saving this man’s life, by making a sacrifice
such as many women make with resignation, even with
joy——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught his meaning, and the blood seemed to congeal
in her heart. She felt cold, so cold that she shivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did God make you?” she said, hanging her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He chose a fine sire and a handsome woman, madam,
and I myself am considered a presentable man. Even you
may grant that I have my points, if I chose to prove
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The power of speech died in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consider awhile. You shall be left in peace for an
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swept his red hat to her, and moved backwards
through the bracken to where John Rich stood biting his
beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, have you done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have but begun, good John; this wine is to my liking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle wasted no time. Martin Valliant saw men
come out of the beech wood carrying roughly shaped posts
and the branches of trees, and for a while their labor puzzled
him. They were setting up a shelter or bower halfway
between the mere and the woodlands, digging the
posts into the ground and lashing the branches of the
trees to them. This forest lodge was left open toward
the island, but closed in on all the other sides with a
dense wall of green leaves. Four short stakes were driven
into the floor of the lodge, and a bed of leaves and bracken
made between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing was barely finished when Fulk de Lisle appeared
on the hillside, followed by a trooper who carried
a piece of white cloth fastened to the staff of his spear.
De Lisle sighted Martin on the tower, pointed with his
riding switch to the white pennon, and came down at a
leisurely pace toward the causeway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz had his eye to the loophole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes the devil on a parley. Go down to the
gate; I will keep watch here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle made his way along the causeway as far
as the raised footbridge, and stood there with an air of
serene insolence, as though he had nothing to fear from
arrow shot or cross-bow bolt. He was wearing no body
armor, and carried no weapon save the dagger at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Martin, a word with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had climbed the ladder to the squint in the
gate-house wall, and he could see Fulk de Lisle’s red
figure framed like a picture. The man had courage, and
knew how to use a smiling audacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Martin Valliant. What do you want with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle raised his eyes to the loop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, Brother Martin? I have come to speak
with you as man to man, and to reason with you over
your madness. That a priest should shed blood is very
shameful, that he should shed it for the sake of a
woman——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am no longer a priest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen awhile, good sir. My Lord of Troy is a devout
gentleman. He would be willing to gloze over this midsummer
madness, for the sake of St. Benedict, even to
the point of sending you back to your cell—for discipline—and
chastisement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ask nothing from my Lord of Troy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem in a furious hurry to be hanged, Brother
Martin. Listen a little further: I will put the matter with
what grace I can, even though the thing is not as delicate
as it should be. There is a certain young gentlewoman
who is a prisoner in our hands. Is not that so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin set his teeth, and made no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your silence is sufficient. Come now, let me tell you
that this young gentlewoman is very loth to see you
hanged, so loth that she is ready to offer that most inestimable
thing—her virtue——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, looking up with an ironical grin at the loop
in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consider this great sacrifice, Brother Martin, for
though it is very flattering to myself——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s face was as gray as the stone. He turned, and
went silently down the ladder, and began to unfasten the
rope that kept the footbridge raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle’s voice taunted him, but grew fainter, for
he was withdrawing along the causeway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tricks will not serve you, Brother Martin. I give you
till nightfall to decide. Come out to us, unarmed, and
wearing nothing but your cassock, and your neck may be
saved. The lady will pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin let the bridge fall with a crash, and sprang to
unbar the gate. His face was the face of a devil, mouth
awry, nostrils agape, his forehead a knot of wrinkles; but
by the time he had the gate open Fulk de Lisle was across
the causeway, and walking back toward the woods, and
several of Rich’s men were moving down to meet him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant stood there, breathing like a man who
had run a mile uphill. He did not hear Swartz come quietly
behind him and take hold of the rope to raise the footbridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, good comrade; that trick shall not work
against you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin turned with a sharp, fierce cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swartz! Let go of that rope! I must die out yonder—or
win through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Swartz heaved the bridge up, fastened the rope,
and stood to face his man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Will you be fooled by that rogue’s tongue?
I heard all that I needed to hear. He came down to try
his wit on you; he prides himself on such pretty quips
and villainies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, I am selling her, betraying her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz struck him a blow on the chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wake—wake! Will that rouse you? To play with a man
like Fulk de Lisle one wants a skin of iron and a brain of
brass. He knew that he could cut you to the quick, drive
you mad. Such things must not be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed Martin aside, and shut the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gird up your soul, Martin Valliant, and set your teeth.
Such a coil as this is not unwound by prayers and whimperings
and such-like softness. Be hard, man, to win. You
shall fight your fight—yet.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXIX</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant and Swartz went back to the
tower, for a stage had been set and the play was
about to begin with the wracking of a man’s soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin leaned against the battlement, his face turned
toward the great beech wood, and his eyes fixed on the
green bower that Rich’s men had built. He had taken
Swartz’s words to heart; he was hardening himself, preparing
to bear his torture without flinching and without uttering
a sound. He thought of the day when he had hung on
the cross to prove himself stronger than Kate Succory’s
youth, and how the physical pain was as nothing to this
torment of the soul. Swartz sat close to him with his back
to the wall, and Swartz’s face was very grim. He had
changed sides, turned rebel; he was a good hound, and
no cur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle had vanished into the beech wood, but in
a short while his red figure reappeared. He stood leaning
with one hand against a tree trunk as though waiting for
some order of his to be obeyed, and Martin Valliant
watched him with steady eyes, letting his anger gather like
deep water behind a dam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something white glimmered under the trees. It drew
nearer, and was led forth into the sunlight close to where
Fulk de Lisle stood waiting. Martin Valliant covered
his eyes with his forearm, and Swartz, who had put
his eye to his squint-hole, rolled aside, and stared at the
sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant said never a word. A new and wonderful
strength seemed to come to him; he uncovered his
eyes, stood up calmly with a face that was like a great
white light. His lips moved, but no sound came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had fastened a rope about Mellis’s neck, and the
man who held the end of the rope had crowned himself
with a wreath of wild flowers. Another fellow who walked
behind had a garland on his spear. Fulk de Lisle’s allegory
burned itself into Martin Valliant’s brain. This beautiful
nakedness was to be sacrificed to shame him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Swartz was cursing to himself. He glanced up at
Martin and stared in an awed way at the man’s white and
shining face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Martin cross himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day I shall kill that man,” he said, as though he
were praying; “I shall not die till I have killed him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis was led through the long grass to the green
bower. She looked at the ground, but once her eyes lifted
to the tower with one tremulous glance of appeal. And
Martin’s soul struggled like a live thing in a cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall not happen!” he said. “By the greatness of
God, it shall not happen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men led her into the bower and made her lie
down upon the bed. One of them tossed a riding-cloak
over her. They cut the rope into four pieces, and tied her
by her wrists and ankles to the four stakes. Their work
was done; they threw their garlands on the ground, and
went off laughing and looking mockingly at Woodmere
tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was watching Fulk de Lisle, who came pacing
with all the airs of a great lord toward the place where
Mellis lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a chance to shoot the red devil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz rubbed his hands together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! I thought so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Lisle was playing a part, and his swaggering was mere
whimsical insolence. He marched up and down in front
of the lodge of leaves, pointing his toes and cocking his
head, the male thing in possession. A servant came down
from the wood with a silver cup full of wine, and Fulk
de Lisle made a great parade of his drinking. He walked
into the bower and drank to Mellis, turned again, and
drank to Martin on the tower. He was in high favor with
himself. Life was a dissolute jest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant heard Swartz whispering to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you come by any plan, brother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only that I am going yonder to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was gray and hard as a winter dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can better that plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will be too much on the alert to give you an
honest chance. If you open the gate and cross the bridge
they will be waiting for you. We must make them face
two ways—scare them a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have my horn with me. Picture us stripped, comrade,
you with a sharp knife, and I with my horn. We swim
the moat after dark, and before the moon is up. I creep
through the grass into the woods, get around behind the
gentry, blow my horn like the last trump, and shout to
my imaginary men to cut the rogues to pieces. We must
trust to them getting a trifle ruffled. You will have to take
your chance of saving the child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stared at him fixedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you doing this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Why do we eat and sleep, man? Because we
must. To cheat that red rogue over there is as natural as
eating. Thunder! but I have forgotten one thing. The
girl would not be able to swim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin hid his knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could carry her over. That is nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love could carry the moon! What say you to my plan,
Martin Valliant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin stooped and caught Swartz by the shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I was near killing you two days ago!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hard blows have begun many a good friendship. My
heart’s with you, Martin Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was agreed between them, that they should
try this desperate venture when darkness came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Martin Valliant it seemed very long in the coming,
though the shadow of the tower lengthened itself across
the water till it touched the grassland beyond the mere.
He watched the fish leaping in the water, and the swallows
skimming the surface and calling shrilly to each
other. As for the sunset, it seemed to set the earth afire
and make everything burn with miraculous color, so that
the grasslands were a great green carpet dusted with
precious stones, and the beech trees all glowing with yellow
light. In that little shelter of leaves Mellis lay white
and still like a sweet saint sleeping in a tomb cut out of
crystal, while Martin Valliant’s fierce restlessness longed
for all this beauty to be blotted out. He could have pulled
the sun down out of the sky, and thrown it into the mere
for the quicker quenching of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle had had a seat made of sods and branches
on the edge of the wood, and he sat there like a great lord
while the men built two fires, one for themselves and one
for their captains, and with the coming of the darkness
these two fires were like great red eyes under the black
brow of the beech wood. A pot was slung over the flames,
and a table set for Fulk de Lisle and John Rich, and
covered with a white cloth. The shelter of leaves lay a
hundred paces or more away from the fires and beyond
the edge of the light. It showed as a dark blur on the
open grassland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had been stripping off his harness, but
Swartz was still on the watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are guarding the causeway. Fulk de Lisle would
not lose his supper for any woman. It is time we made a
beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin gathered up his armor, and they went down into
the courtyard. Swartz was fumbling at the points of his
hose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse these knots! Give me your knife, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He cut himself out of his clothes, chuckling fiercely.
Martin had laid his armor and his sword beside the
postern leading into the garden; he had stripped himself
of everything save his short cassock, for the thing would
not spoil his swimming, and it hid the whiteness of his
body. Old Swartz came out haired like an ape, his horn
slung to his neck by a stout cord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is your knife, man. We had best take to the
water on the farther side, and paddle across softly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed through the orchard where the grass and
weeds brushed their knees, and Swartz talked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Crawl around and get as near as you can to the child.
Then, wait—and have patience. I shall have to make a
wide sweep. When you hear me blowing my horn and
shouting, you must be ready to make your dash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was grimly cool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall waste no time,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood for a moment to look at the two fires and
the men gathered around them. The blaze lit the trunks
of the beech trees and made the lower branches shine
like brass. A man was fishing meat out of the iron pot
with a dagger. Fulk de Lisle’s red figure was the color of
blood; he had a cup in his hand and was about to drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While gluttons eat, wise men are up and doing. The
hour is ripe for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They struck the water on the far side of the island,
where willows grew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, God’s good luck to us, comrade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their hands met. Then Martin let himself down into
the water, and Swartz followed him. They paddled slowly
and softly across with hardly a splash, Martin swimming
with his knife in his right hand. The mere was as black
as a well, and the willows hid them from the men who
watched the causeway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they reached the shallows under the farther bank
they crouched and listened. There was no shouting; no
alarm—not a sound save the faint lapping of a few ripples
among the reeds and sedges. Martin climbed out, and
gave Swartz his hand. There was a thorn tree growing
within a few paces of the water, and they took cover under
it before parting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a minute’s start, Valliant. I shall make a track
well out into the open, and then turn toward the woods.
God grant the mud has not got into this horn of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped away into the long grass, and Martin knew
that all that he held most dear hung on the good faith of
Peter Swartz.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXX</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant did not tarry long under
the thorn tree. He knelt for a moment to listen,
and then started on his way around the mere,
crawling on hands and knees through the rich rank grass
that grew near the water. It was wet with dew, and the
brown sorrel and the great white daisies brushed against
his face. The smell of the green growth touched him like
a subtle, clinging memory. He did not think of death or
wounds, but only of Mellis and what might happen to her
if he failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Skirting the mere, he came to the sluice ditch, all
choked with shrubs and brambles. The ditch was less than
two hundred paces from the causeway, and about the
same distance from the shelter of leaves, and Martin
scrambled down and took cover in spite of the thorns
and brambles. He half stood and half lay, with his head
and shoulders above the bank, and a stunted thorn
stretching a canopy above him. He could see the two fires,
and Fulk de Lisle’s red figure. Mellis’s bower lay between
the sluice ditch and the camp fires; Martin could not pick
it out of the darkness, though he strained his eyes till the
lids began to flicker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, he knew where she lay, and there was nothing for
him to do but to lie still and wait for Swartz’s horn. He
could feel his heart beating as he leaned against the grassy
bank. Every nerve and muscle in him seemed a-quiver.
He fingered the point and edge of his knife, and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a strange thought came to him. What if he failed—what
if he found the adventure hopeless?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would die—he meant to die in such a case—but
Mellis would be living. He would go out into the great
darkness leaving her alone. Rough hands might do what
they pleased with her. Fulk de Lisle would come down
full of his wine, violent and inflamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin fondled his knife. One blow, and all that would
be saved. And yet he recoiled from the thought with a
spasm of tenderness and horror. To strike that white
body of hers, to hear her cry out, to know that her blood
was flowing! The passion in him hardened to an iron
frenzy. He would not fail; no strength should master him;
nothing should say him nay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had fought through those moments of
a man’s strong anguish when Swartz’s horn brayed in the
deeps of the beech wood. Martin did not wait to see what
would happen. He was out of the ditch and running
through the long grass like a greyhound loosed after a
hare. He knew where the shelter of leaves should be; that
was all that mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet his senses were dimly aware of other things that
were happening. Swartz was shouting like a madman, “At
them! At them! Cut the swine to pieces!” Fulk de Lisle
had sprung to his feet and was facing toward the beech
wood; his men were rushing to arms. The fellows on the
causeway had left their post and were trailing across the
grass to join their comrades by the fires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went like the wind, conscious of a wild exultation.
A black shape loomed in front of him, like a hay-cock
in a field. He reached it, fell on his knees, and
crawled into its shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her cry out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin—oh, my comrade!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t speak, child. I must cut those ropes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groped for her right arm, found it, and cut the
thong that fastened her wrist to the stake. To free her left
arm he had to lean over her body, but the second rope was
cut, and of a sudden he felt her arms about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her great joy and her love would not be stifled. Her
arms held him close, and for a moment he lay on her
bosom, feeling her breath on his face, and the beating of
her heart answering his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own dear mate——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child, it is life and death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He freed himself, and cut the ropes that bound her
ankles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was up like a blown leaf, holding the cloak over
her bosom with one hand, and running at his side. Martin
looked back at the fires. Confusion still fooled Fulk de
Lisle and his men. There was much running to and fro
and shouting under the beech trees, and no grasping, as
yet, of the trick that had been played them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin felt himself touched upon the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are all wet, dear comrade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to swim across.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave an exquisite, shy laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mere is an old friend. You will not have to carry
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There flashed on Martin Valliant a swift new consciousness
of her as a woman, a woman who trusted
him as a bird flies to its mate. A great white light had
blazed for him, lighting such an awe of her that the
very thought of touching her had seemed sacrilege. And
now a miraculous thing had happened. Her arms had
held him; she was not afraid; and in the soft darkness
her eyes sought his. His awe of her melted to a deep
and exultant tenderness. He wanted to tell her how
beautiful she was, that he was ready to die for her, that
she was the most wonderful and adorable thing in the
whole world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have no fear,” he said, “for no harm shall come to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear! I have no fear of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God be thanked. We have been close to the edge
of hell, Mellis, you and I, to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her draw her breath as though in pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me forget it—let me forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mere lay at their feet, black and still and welcoming.
There was no pursuit as yet, though Fulk de
Lisle was turning his eyes and his thoughts to Mellis
and the shelter of leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blessed water!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stepped confidently into the mere, and went forward
till the water rose above her waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“S-sh! How sweet and cold it is! Martin—my cloak!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had folded it over her bosom and shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no saving it,” and she laughed softly; “the
thing must get soaked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it to me. I can carry it above my head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no; something else must serve. Mother of Heaven—they
are after us—at last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let the cloak drop, and left it floating as she
dipped to the water and struck out for the island. Martin
caught it up and followed her, blessing the darkness for
its friendliness. He glanced over his shoulder as he swam,
and saw a dozen red lights tossing toward them over the
grassland. Fulk de Lisle had sent a man to the shelter
of leaves, and its emptiness had been discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis was swimming so swiftly that he had to strike
out hard to overtake her. Her arm came out and cut
the water like a silver sickle, each stroke striking a little
splash of foam. Martin drew to her, and they swam side
by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall beat them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please God. The torches will not show the farther
bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you can swim!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always loved this side stroke. I could beat my
brother in a race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her whiteness played near him under the black swirl
of the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way. The bank is low by the orchard; we can
land there. That man! I was forgetting him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swartz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her sudden, sensitive trepidation thrilled him. He
found that he had forgotten Swartz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swartz is in the woods over yonder. He swam across
with me. It was his horn that you heard. We owe—this—to
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! He is on our side now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is noble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the shallows just as Fulk de Lisle’s
torches came flaring to the landward bank. The men
could see nothing but ripples; the light did not carry
to the island. One of the fellows hurled his torch out
into the darkness at a venture. It kissed the water, threw
out a momentary radiance, and went out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was up the bank, and reaching for Mellis’s
hands. They heard Fulk de Lisle cursing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, we have fooled them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came out to him like a child, dim, dripping, exultant.
Her hands held his without shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw the wet cloak over her, but she cast it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that clammy thing. The night is warm, and I am
all aglow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put up her hands, and in a second her hair came
clouding down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What now? Dear man, they will be mad. You must
get your harness and stand ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was moving away when new sounds came out of
the darkness of the night. A horn blared in the woods; a
man screamed in agony; there was the noise of men running,
and shouting as they ran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin turned and looked across the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis was at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you hear that cry? ‘Richmond! Richmond!’ It is
John Falconer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man in armor, whose horse was half unmanageable,
blundered out into the light of the fires. It was John Rich.
He waved his sword, and shouted to Fulk de Lisle,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To us! To us! We are attacked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle’s torches went tossing up the hill; but
before he and his men reached the beech wood, the fight
came tumbling out like a drove of swine. John Rich was
down with an arrow through his throat, and his horse went
charging straight at the torches. Fulk de Lisle caught the
beast by the bridle, swung himself into the saddle, and
snatched a spear from one of his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Troy! Troy! Hold together, lads!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But that rough and tumble on the edge of the wood was
no fitting stage for flamboyant feats of arms. Falconer’s
men poured out in a black swarm. The fighting was at
close quarters, a wild swirl of jerking and grotesque figures,
a tangle of men and horses, torches, flying embers, oaths
and blows. The fires were kicked out, smothered by the
bodies of men who fell on them, and rolled away—cursing.
Torches were flung, tossed back again, trampled under
foot. There was no knightliness in the game. It was a battle
of wild beasts who were in a mad haste to kill. My Lord of
Troy’s men had raped and bullied the Forest, and the
Forest was taking its vengeance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis’s head was close to Martin’s shoulder, and his
arm had slipped about her body. Neither of them spoke.
The work up yonder was too grim, too breathless. The
fires were scattered; a few torches flared in the grass; the
dance of death became a thing of darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a horse went galloping down past the mere, a
dim, hurrying shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin strained his eyes. A faint radiance was stealing
over the grassland, the light of the rising moon. The horse
became a gray ghost carrying a man who rode for safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who should it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fulk de Lisle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That devil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bloody game under the black shadows of the
beeches seemed to be losing its fury. Men were calling to
each other in the darkness; there was a kind of whimpering
murmur, a vague scattering of voices. Once a man shrieked
aloud, and Martin felt Mellis shiver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is over. Look, you can see men running. One, two,
and another—over there, in the open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it with us, or against us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Troy is beaten. Hear them shouting—our people, ‘Richmond!
Richmond!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a night, comrade, what a night!”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A broad silver radiance spread above the black
tops of the beech trees. It was the moon rising
behind the wood, throwing long slants of light
across the grasslands, and making a glimmer of mystery
everywhere. The towering shadow of the beech wood still
lay upon the island and the mere, leaving them all black
in a world of tremulous white light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis drew aside suddenly, her arms over her bosom,
her eyes looking toward the tops of the beech trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A something in her voice kept him from looking at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must become a man. This adventure has shipwrecked
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was most desperately and dearly perplexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there no cloth anywhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not help laughing at his immense seriousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you forgotten? Ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon seemed to glide suddenly above the beech
wood, huge, and yellow, and stealthy. The shadows slipped
away from the island; the long grass glimmered like silver
wire; the mere shone like a shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis threw herself in the long grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you forgotten all our gear in that cellar? If you
love me, man—hasten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall I bring?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A suit of light armor, and a wadded coat—and—and—things
to go under it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He blundered off, calling himself the most imbecile fool
that ever was; but before he had got across the orchard he
heard Falconer hailing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had other matters to attend to. John Falconer
could wait. But he gave him an answering shout,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that Master Falconer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All’s well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let down the bridge, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in good season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin ran to the tower, groped for the ring of the great
stone, found it, and then remembered that he would need
a light. The tinder-box and the candles were in Mellis’s
room. He was about to go for them when he heard a
sound of soft footsteps, and some one glided up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need a light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The tinder-box is above. Come to me in a moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted the stone out, rolled it aside, and waited. He
could hear the ring of the flint against the steel, and then
her voice calling to him softly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here. It is lighted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin climbed the stairs and found a candle burning
outside her door. He picked it up, holding it in one big
hand and shading it as though that flame was one of the
most precious things in the world. The light played upon
his solemn face, and mirrored itself in his grave, intent
eyes. He held his breath all the way down the stairs; the
flame was a flickering soul, and he was guarding it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Martin lowered himself into the vault, and setting
that precious candle on a stone bracket let into the wall,
he made a great disorder among the stuff that was stored
there. The idea of thoroughness obsessed him, of not letting
Mellis lack for anything that might be of use in such
a crisis. He made three journeys to the landing outside
her chamber door, and the merchandise that was piled
there testified to his sincerity. It included a suit of light
mail; a woolen doublet and hose to be worn beneath it;
a belt, sword and dagger; leather shoes; an odd piece of
green cloth that bows had been wrapped in; some strips of
leather; a green and blue banner rolled in a canvas bag.
He left the candle burning there, and went down to lower
the bridge for Falconer and his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer had torches with him, and the causeway
was a glare of light. Martin lowered the bridge and swung
the gate open; Falconer came across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at Martin Valliant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo! This is a queer way to go harnessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is much to be told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the child safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is in her chamber. Her men were ambushed this
morning, and she was taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer nodded understandingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been in the water, my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swartz and I swam across to rescue her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swartz? Peter Swartz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is with us now. He went into the woods to raise an
alarm, while I saved Mellis. Warn your men that he is a
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin and John Falconer passed on into the courtyard,
and the Forest followed them with a tossing of torches,
and much grim jubilation. The men were as diverse and
rustic as their weapons. Oak clubs, scythe blades on poles,
axes, spits, wooden mallets, all came dancing into the yard
of Woodmere. Many of the men had bows on their backs
and arrows stuck in their belts. Not a few were wounded.
There were bloody faces, arms that hung limp, stockings
soaked all red. But the crowd was hot, triumphant, and
fiercely merry; they had tasted blood; many vile things had
been avenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look to your wounds, lads. Lay a fire, some of you.
We have come far, and no man is grudged his supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several of the Forest gentry gathered around Falconer,
and looked curiously at Martin Valliant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this the fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has some limbs on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a runaway priest, gentles, is black company. What
say you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer answered them gruffly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what are we but traitors, so long as Crookback
wears the crown! Men who can fight are the blood and
muscle of such a venture as ours. Use your wits, gentlemen.
We are not women to tilt our noses and screw up our
mouths.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had drawn aside. He felt a stranger and almost
an outcast under the eyes of these mesne lords who stared
at him and did not lower their voices. The mysterious and
solitary nights and days had vanished. He saw Mellis surrounded
by a crowd of figures, knights, yeomen, foresters.
They seemed to thrust him back into the darkness; he had
served his purpose and no one held out a hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gathered up his harness from the spot where he had
left it by the gate that led into the garden, and made his
way into the orchard. The life had gone out of him for the
moment; this secret and love-enchanted island had been
seized by a hundred rough fellows who shouted and
crowded in the courtyard. He did not belong to them; he
was a thing to be eyed with distrust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moonlight flooded the orchard, and Martin sat
down under an apple tree and began to arm himself, but
there was no pride of purpose in his hands. Bitter thoughts
crowded into his heart, and he sank in a slough of self-abasement.
He had been in heaven, and suddenly he found
himself in hell. What was he but an outcast, a murderer,
a thing that was neither priest nor man? And he had believed
for one short hour that Mellis loved him. What
madness! What could he be to her, or she to him? He had
mistaken a child’s gratitude for the love of the woman.
The danger was past, for she was in the midst of friends;
he had played his part, and the dream was ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the melancholy circle of his thoughts drifted a
sound of some one moving through the orchard grass.
Martin was in the shadow of the tree, and the moonlight
showed him a primeval figure scouting furtively toward
the house. It was Swartz, naked, and very cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin hailed him, and the man of the horn joined him
under the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God be blessed; all the devils in hell seem loose to-night!
A dance I have had of it, everyone’s enemy and no
man’s friend. These Forest worthies have been hunting me
like a pig. I had to take to the water and sit with my chin
in it under the bank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was shivering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My kingdom for a bit of lamb’s wool, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you leave your clothes, man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On my lady’s table in the garden, God forgive me!
But if those wild devils get a sight of such a thing as I
am—I shall have a scythe blade between my ribs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin was in too grim and sad a mood to see the
ludicrous in Peter Swartz. He rose, went into the garden,
and returned with the soldier’s clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corn in Egypt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz tumbled into them, his teeth chattering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo! those fellows are lighting a fire; they must be
taught to love Peter Swartz. And I would not quarrel with
some wine and a bite of supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s melancholy was not a thing that could be overlooked.
Swartz discovered it, and ceased his prattling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, man, things did not go amiss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. She is safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz was trying to remedy the disastrous haste of his
undressing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the curse of the prophet fall on these tags and
tatters! What ails you, man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let it be nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared hard at Martin, puzzled by his strange sullenness,
but too shrewd to vex it further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Falconer came in finely—like a pot boiling over.
And Messire Fulk de Lisle has gone galloping home to
Troy; he passed within five yards of me. Hallo—cheering!
They are in great heart, yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those rough men in the ruined court of Woodmere
had seen a vision, for Mellis had come out to them, clad
in bright harness, her dark hair pouring over it, a naked
sword in her hands. Behind her walked John Falconer,
carrying a green and blue banner fastened to the throat of
a lance. The men crowded from the fire, and from every
corner of the courtyard. And she stood and spoke to them
in a clear, calm voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good gentlemen and comrades all, I thank you for
coming to me. We have begun bravely. God speed King
Harry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They cheered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shout, lads, for our captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mistress Mellis—Mistress Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let Roger Bland try to take ye from us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and there be more of us a-comin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis’s eyes were restless, searching for something that
she could not see. She turned and spoke to John Falconer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer shook his head. She grew imperious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call him. He must be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man may have some shame, Mellis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed with sensitive wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame! God forgive you. Ah! I see how things have
sped!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer’s eyes shirked meeting hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There may be draughts that men are loth to swallow,”
he said dourly; “I did not make the world or men’s hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood a moment, with dark, thinking eyes and a
proud, hurt face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am young—still. Oh, these jealous tangles that men
weave! Must we be little and thankless for the sake of
fools?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis made her way through the crowd of mesne lords
and gentlemen, looking neither to the right hand nor the
left. They stood back for her, for she was proud, more pure
in her strength than they. The moon hung clear and white
and splendid in the sky, shining on her face and the plated
steel half hidden by her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they would think him an outcast,” she said to herself.
“My scorn is theirs for the asking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some instinct led her through the garden into the
orchard, where the long grass was all patterned with the
black shadows of the trees. She stood in the moonlight,
and called softly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Swartz crept away, a dog grown mute, and wise in
his silence. Martin’s face was all twisted with a spasm of
pain, for he was fey that night with a mysterious forefeeling
of great sorrow and despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came down through the orchard, and Martin rose
to his feet. The moonlight through the trees shone on his
harness, and betrayed him to her. He stood absolutely still,
waiting for her to draw near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice had a soft, wounded plaintiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you hiding here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was all somber in the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a wish to be alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not bring himself to look at her, because of the
new bitterness in his heart, and because her voice was so
soft and luring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened to you, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went close, looking in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me. Have I no right to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered her with strange gentleness, but his eyes
would not meet hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I have seen a vision, a glimpse of the world as
it is. Some things are too beautiful to endure, for other
men break them in pieces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew her breath deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Have these rough fools touched your pride? They
can have my scorn for the asking. And are you nothing to
me, or I to you? Have we not gone through the deeps
together, and have you not carried my life in your hands?
Man, what do these rough squires matter? Look into my
eyes and see if there is shame in them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis—what am I but an outcast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I am an outcast also. But for me you would be
chanting your Masses. And you have been very noble and
good to me. Oh, Martin, Martin! this wounds my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave a sudden cry, and fell on his knees before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help me, but there is nothing else in the world
but you. I cannot bear that for my sake you should even
suffer pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent over him, her hands hovering close to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pain! What pain is there? And were it real—should I
not bear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forbid! Child, I have a kind of dark forefeeling
to-night. Yesterday was all sunlight, there was no fear or
sorrow in my heart. I was Martin Valliant, a man who was
ready to die for you. What has happened? I feel a menace,
a threat, a shadow drifting toward us; we are not alone;
other voices strike in on ours. This island is not the world;
here—I could serve you; but beyond us there are shadows,
the shadows of other men—other women; they whisper
together against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great light transfigured her face. She was on her knees,
her hands on his shoulders, her eyes wonderful to behold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, what has come to us? Oh, my dear, must I
speak out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her, awed, trembling, entranced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis, Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not my fate yours—and yours mine? What is pain to
you is pain to me. If there is a world of shadows before us,
I go—where my man goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He uttered a deep cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I touch you? Is it possible? Will you not melt into
the air? Oh, my God! but I dare hardly look at you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, I am a soul in a body. What am I but a
woman? Guard me—hold me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His arms went around her, but they were all tremulous
with awe. Her face was close to his, a white, yearning face,
with parted lips and half-closed eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis—oh, my heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lay in his arms and smiled at him as he kissed her.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle rode all that night, a madman, inflamed,
balked of the satisfaction of a violent desire.
He had nothing but the stars and the moon to
guide him; the Forest was no more than a pathless waste;
he pushed northwards, raging like a torch burning in the
wind. At dawn his horse died under him, driven by the
spurs till its heart failed on the brow of a steep hill. Fulk
de Lisle kicked the beast’s body, and looked with red eyes
at a gray and silent world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the luck was with him—the luck of the adventurer
and the drunkard. Dim and sullen, Troy Castle stood less
than two miles away on its great hill; the rising sun struck
slantwise upon it, so that it looked like a huge turreted
ship sailing above a sea of green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle came on his own feet to Troy Castle.
There was a sense of stir about the place although the
day was still so young. A couple of dusty and sweat-streaked
horses were waiting outside the gate-house; grooms
and servants were gossiping, and on the battlements soldiers
were unlashing the canvas covers of my lord’s cannon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some one on the walls recognized Fulk de Lisle when
he was a quarter of a mile from the dry fosse; there was
some shouting and running to and fro; a man vaulted on
to the back of one of the tired horses and went cantering
down the road. He was a squire in Roger Bland’s service,
a youngster with red hair and an impudent mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning to you, sir. Why this humility?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle took him by the leg and pitched him out
of the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I will ride the last furlong, and help you to
mend your manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Red Head scrambled up and dusted his clothes. Fulk de
Lisle was too soaring a bird for him to fly at, but his
impudence refused to be chastened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust your news is better than your face, sir. Our dear
lord has the ague this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle rode on, without troubling to turn the
lad’s wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clattered over the bridge and into the main court,
and the men who saw him ride in stared at his savage face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pride has had a fall,” said some one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or been balked of a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle called a page who was loitering on the
steps of the chapel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you nothing but eyes, you brat? Where is my
lord?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In his closet, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run and tell him that I am in the castle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland already had the news, and his groom of
the chamber came out with a haggard face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord would see you—instantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damnation—may not a man eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord of Troy sat in his great padded chair with a
writing-board on his knees, and quills and an inkhorn on
the table at his side. He looked white about the gills, with
that whiteness that tells of a faltering heart; his hand had
lost its steady, clerkly niceness, and there were blots upon
the paper. He had not been barbered, and still wore a
gorgeous crimson bed-gown that made his thin face look
all the yellower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this—what’s this, man? Shut that door, Bennington.
Not more bad news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was petulant to the point of childishness. Fulk de
Lisle’s red-brown eyes looked at him with veiled and
subtle scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not make it worse, my lord. The Forest is up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Forest—in arms against us! Man—you are dreaming!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very wide awake, sir. We were ambushed last
night as we lay outside Woodmere. They must have been
a hundred to our thirty. We made a fight of it; that is all
that can be said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland’s face twitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many men came back with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a short silence. My Lord of Troy’s fingers
were playing with his quill. He looked old and querulous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These swine! I thought we had tamed them. There is
a deeper cunning in all this. I have had secret news this
very morning. Richmond is on the sea. By now he may
have landed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle took the news as a soldier of fortune takes
his pay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The King will not grudge him a battle, my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bombast is so easy. But to say who are friends and who
are enemies! Supposing I chose to have you hanged, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A most unreasonable fancy, my lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have risked my neck in your service. I have no quarrel
with your generosity. And my pride is concerned in this—the
pride of a soldier and a captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see, sir; I may let you prove it. And now—we
must strike, and strike quickly. These letters shall go at
once; they must not miscarry. In three days we should
muster a hundred spears and two hundred archers. The
falconets and serpents are to come from Roychester; Sir
Humphrey Heron will be master of the cannon. I have
chosen my gallopers. Look to the garrison, and see that
our tenants are fitly armed as they come in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart is in this venture, my lord,” he said; “you
can trust me, because my blood is up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Roger Bland’s gallopers went out from Troy Castle,
carrying letters to Sir Humphrey Heron at Roychester, to
Sir Paul Scrooby at Granet, and to such lords and gentlemen
as favored the White Rose. The rallying place was to
be Troy Castle. Naught was said of the Earl of Richmond
being upon the seas, for such news might have aroused a
dubious loyalty among the gentry of those parts, where
fear ruled and the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I charge you to come to me with all your might—and
within three days—for the chastening and humbling of
certain rebels and traitors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So ran the Lord of Troy’s message. These smaller fires
had to be quenched before the great beacon burst into a
blaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord of Troy had eyes in Gawdy Town to serve him,
and men were watching to see the Rose come into port;
but, seeing that she carried merchandise that was too
precious to be fingered, her master elected to lower it overboard
before making the land. The Rose came towering
along about sunset, with a mild breeze behind her. The
sea was a deep purplish blue, and the red west promised
fair weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her master had put the ship on a strange course. She
hung out to sea till the land grew gray with the dusk, and
then, turning her gilded bows shorewards, footed it solemnly
toward the land. No one in Gawdy Town had seen
her topsails. The gossips on the quay said that she would
not make port before the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a mile from the land the Rose backed her sails
and lay to. The sky was all blue-green above, the sea black
as pitch, and the land, with its Forest ridge, looked like a
great cloud-bank. The Rose lowered two boats, each
manned by half a dozen seamen. Baggage was tumbled
into them from the waist, and about a score of voyagers
left the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The master stood on the poop and lifted his hat to them
as the boats pulled away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good market to you, gentlemen,” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep voice answered him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God save the King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boats went shorewards at a good speed, looking like
two gray beetles on the water crawling with white legs, the
foam from the oars. They melted into the dusk, and the
Rose veered and beat up against the breeze, to play mother
till her boats returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baggage and the twenty adventurers were landed
in a horseshoe-shaped cove under the cliffs. Some one had
been watching for them above, for a couple of men came
scampering down the steep path, one of them waving a
piece of red cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All’s well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The seamen pushed off and rowed back toward the
Rose, but the men stood in a group on the shingle and
talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The King is at sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Forest is up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So soon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman as usual! They stabbed young Dale in Gawdy
Town, and would have taken his sister. So Falconer raised
the Forest. Bland’s men came to beleaguer Woodmere;
we ambushed thirty of them last night, so the fat is in the
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the deep voice, who seemed to be the
leader, betrayed a savage impatience. He had the hard, flat,
high-cheeked face of a Mongol, with a brutal mouth, and
cold blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil fly away with all women! Young Dale was a
fool to take the wench with him, and Falconer was a fool
to trouble his head about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not the whole story, Sir Gregory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn your story! They have rushed matters too rashly.
We may have to fight before we are ready. Now for the
baggage. Have you any horses above?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bustle up, then. The sooner we are knee-deep in the
Forest the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baggage was carried up the cliff and lashed on the
backs of the pack-horses. The men who had landed were
well armed under their cloaks. Sir Gregory took the lead,
one of the foresters walking beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, man, this story of yours; let us hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forester told all that he knew concerning Mellis and
her championing by Martin Valliant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The round-headed man was not pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beelzebub—what a beginning! A blackguard monk is a
pretty stormcock to open the hurly-burly for us. Fools are
superstitious, and I am one of the fools.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXIII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Forest had sounded its war-horn, and the woods
and heaths and leaf-hidden hamlets gave up their
men. They gathered in Woodmere valley, foresters,
laborers, charcoal burners, breeders of horses, swineherds,
and a scattering of broken men. The gentry and their
tenants were passably horsed and harnessed; the foresters
had their bows; but there was many a fellow who had no
more than an oak cudgel or a scythe blade lashed to a pole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They brought cattle and sheep with them and tumbrils
laden with sacks of flour. Booths were built, fires lit, scouts
sent to watch the woodland ways and the gray menace of
Troy Castle. The vault at Woodmere was emptied of its
arms, and a new bridge built in place of Martin’s single
beam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Martin Valliant, he held aloof from the mesne
lords and slept at night across Mellis’s door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the Forest was superstitious, and devout with the
devoutness of ignorance. There was no wild thing that
could not happen, no marvel that might not be believed.
God, the Virgin and the Saints, the devil and his progeny
were part of the Forest life, mysterious beings to be prayed
to and to be feared. There were holy wells, wonder-working
images in more than one of the churches, places
that were accursed, goblin stones, devil’s hounds that ran
by night, headless horsemen, ghosts, fairies, haunted trees.
The people of the Forest were obstinate, credulous children.
They believed all that the Church taught them, even
though many a priest spat at his own conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had been a priest. He had shed blood,
and he slept at night outside the door of a woman’s bed-chamber.
The facts were flagrant, fiercely honest. Your
pious savage does not love honesty; he lives in a world of
make-believe; he will not quarrel with imperfections that
spue their slime in dark and hidden corners. He will even
laugh and delight in the lewd tales that are told of priests.
But let some priest be honest, shake off his vows, and
declare himself a clean man, then he has committed the
unforgivable sin, and any foul sot or filthy hag may sit in
judgment upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it proved with these rough Forest gentry. Martin
Valliant had sensed things truly. That sudden shadowy
foreboding had heralded a real darkness that was spreading
toward him from the mistrusts and prejudices of these
common men. They looked at the facts baldly as they
would have looked at pigs in a sty. The strange, tragic,
sacrificial beauty of the thing was lost on them. To them
love was a giggling scrimmage. Their religion was so much
bogey worship, a rude mysticism that was shaped to suit
their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before a day had passed Martin Valliant found himself
outlawed by a vague and reticent distrust. He cast a
shadow. The common men looked askance at him and
held aloof. The gentry were more open, and more brutal
in their displeasure; with them it was not a mere matter of
superstition; there were young men among them, and
Mellis was very comely. And this fellow had the insolence
to sleep across her door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer was the only man who spoke to Martin Valliant,
and it was done grudgingly and with an ill grace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest looked through him, over him, at his feet.
There was no place for Martin at the table that had been
set up under a shelter of boughs in the hall. Even Peter
Swartz was better treated; he was half prisoner, half comrade,
but he drank and ate with them, diced with them,
told tales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin took his meals on the leads of the tower or in
the garden. His heart grew heavy in him, and a kind of
fierce sadness showed in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These English worthies were ready with their judgments
as they sat at table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wench is mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fellow is wearing her brother Gilbert’s harness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a thing cannot be stomached, sirs. We lack godliness
if we carry such an unclean vagabond with us. My
men are grumbling already, and seeing a curse in the
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send him back to Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The prior will thank you for nothing. One kicks a
mangy dog out of the gate, and that’s the end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz listened and said nothing. He was a rough god
compared with these boors; he had seen the world and
tasted the wine of many countries, and he knew that it is
mere foolishness to step in between a clown and his drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer tried to speak up, but they were against him to
a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I choose to live with honest men, sir, not with vermin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the Forest’s verdict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the second day the gentlemen of the Rose marched
into Woodmere, Sir Gregory at their head. There was
much cheering, much shaking of hands. “The King was
upon the sea.” That night they drank much ale. And
women had come from Gawdy Town, bold-eyed wenches
dressed as men. Some of the wilder spirits made a rough
night of it, shouting, quarreling, and singing songs, and
Mellis was kept awake by their clowning. Nor did Martin
Valliant get much sleep, for he had to take more than one
drunken man by the shoulders and prove to him that the
threshold of Mellis’s chamber was sacred ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coming of Sir Gregory and the gentlemen from
France made matters more sinister for Martin Valliant.
Sir Gregory was a man of violent self-pride, obstinate as
sin, and far more cruel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bearded John Falconer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pretty chaplain you have found us! This fellow must
go, or I’ll not answer for the men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We owe him some gratitude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for what? Bloodying our game for us? Dale was a
fool in the beginning, and you have been little better than
his shadow. I’ll have no women picking and choosing in
my company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer owned as rough a temper as this crop-headed
bully, but he knew that Sir Gregory had the crowd at his
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no harm done yet. I will speak to the girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What claim has the wench to be considered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The claim of courtesy—and compassion, sir. Look to it,
Gregory, I will have none of the bully in you; my fist is as
heavy as ever it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And there the matter rested for a while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer did not deceive himself; these mesne
lords and squirelings were no children of romance. The
wars had bred a savage spirit in the land; the middle age
was dying, cruel and brutish in its decadence, and the
strong man was not there as yet to smite it down forever
with his kingly club. Martin Valliant would have to go;
these men of the Forest would not hesitate to sacrifice
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mellis?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hardened his heart, and went in search of her, and
finding her in the tower room, he shut the door and spoke
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child, this man cannot stay with us; he will bring us
evil luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who sent you with that message, John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole place is whispering it. It might have been
born with the men, but our friends will have none of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood at her full height, calmly scorning him and
them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an amazing thing is life! You come to me, and
bid me turn on this man, and hound him out as an outcast.
Am I so vile and heartless a thing, and are men so afraid
of the devil that they must throw a sop to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer stood his ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should know the Forest, Mellis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the trees and the glades, the blown leaves and
the sunlight, the little streams and the deer—but its men!
If these are they, I know them not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valliant has blackened himself in their eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flung out her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for whom, and for what purpose? I tell you that
man has the heart of a child. I was in peril, and he succored
me; I was lost, and he gave me his all. Nay, more
than his all, for in saving me he lost the good will of God’s
noble men. And you—you come to me and tell me to
spurn him, desert him, because these fools are afraid of the
devil. I would rather die than stoop to such shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was clouded and stubborn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your heart is too kind, because——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Speak out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went nearer, her eyes dangerously shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not afraid, John Falconer. Tell me I love this
man. I do most dearly love him, with all my heart and
soul. And who shall cast a reproach at me, or make me
believe that there is any man who would have treated me
with such sweet, strong faith? I care not what men say.
God shall judge. If there is beauty and tenderness and
truth in our poor hearts, will He throw us to the dogs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mad!” he said miserably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mad! Then I would that all the world were mad! And
if your law is God’s law, then I am a rebel against God.
Yes, and I would glory in it. I have no more to say to you,
John Falconer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left her, ashamed, angry, feeling that tragic things
were about to happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Martin Valliant, he knew what he knew, and his
heart was heavy. He thought of the lepers in the wood of
yews at Paradise, and his lot seemed like unto theirs. Love
had made him an outcast, a thing of evil omen to be thrust
away into the darkness. No one was ready to call him
brother or comrade in arms, or to pity him because the man
had been stronger than the monk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strove bitterly with himself and with his love, but
the truth showed him no mercy. It was like the great
wooden cross on the Black Moor, standing bleak and clear
against the sunset, bidding mortals remember that Christ
suffered. He understood why these men hated and mistrusted
him, and grudged him the right of guarding Mellis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Words were spoken that were meant for his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The monks of Paradise have earned a foul name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have reared a fine, upstanding rogue in that
fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Old Valliant’s son. A pretty mate for Mellis Dale!
What shame for the woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant could bear no more. If his homage
meant shame for her, then it had better end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went in search of Mellis, but for a long time he
could not find her, and the house and island seemed full
of fools who stared at him. Martin Valliant’s humility was
in the dust. Had he been a fiercer and more carnal man,
a strong and striving selfishness might have carried him
through; but the rebel spirit faltered in him when voices
whispered that the woman suffered shame because he loved
her. Generous souls are always at the mercy of the meaner
and more cunning spirits. A clever lie, like a snake crawling
from the mouth of a sorcerer, has bitten many a strong
man’s heel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin found his love in a far corner of the orchard
where an old tree had been blown down, but still lived
and threw out green leaves. Mellis was seated on the trunk
and half among the boughs, so that she was hidden like
a bird, and discoverable only by some one who came quite
near, for the weeds and grass were rank and tall, and
melted into the green of the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood before her, sorrowful and heavy-eyed, and she
knew why he had come to her and what was in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes loved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So these clowns have been pulling ugly faces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered her simply and sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be that the clowns are right. We live our lives
among clowns; we must not live too finely, or the clowns
will be displeased. Is it not a sin to offend even against
fools?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left her seat on the tree and stood facing him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they would drive you out—send you to beggary or
death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They think me accursed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hands went to his shoulders, but his arms remained
rigid, and he did not move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant, the rebel in me fights for you. Why
should we truckle to this clowns’ world? What does it
know of my heart or of yours? Why, we could go on living
to the mean level of the beasts, throwing our pearls in the
troughs, forever and ever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what I was—and what I am!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, man, I love you! Is there shame or sin in my eyes?
Why, there was no true beauty in the world till we began
to love each other. And am I to disown you, send you
back to your death, because these lords and gentlemen
have unclean, grudging hearts? No—by my God, I will not
let you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood rigid, opening and shutting his hands. His eyes
looked into hers appealingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, child, they speak shameful things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them call me all the foul names that ever were.
Am I touched by them? It is for me to choose. And I say
to you that they shall not part us. For if you love me,
Martin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gripped his arms, and her face lay close to his, her
lips open, her eyes full of soft gleams. Her voice was quick,
passionate, and challenging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For if you love me, dear——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared at her, head thrown back, his eyes filling with
a strange, wild light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death—what would death be? But here is life and
desire—and beauty. Oh, my heart, play me not false! They
shall not take you from me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis—dear heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held her at arm’s length, his face transfigured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help me! If this is sin—then let them write it
down against me. Why, all that I hold here, the most
adorable thing in all the world——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The beauty, the mystery of you, the white light in my
soul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! ah! Can mortal men harm us? We will hold to
each other, you and I. Is not the whole world open, and
can these so-called comrades say us nay? Where you go, I
go also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it, child,” he said.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXIV</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>About dusk that day, as Martin was passing through
the courtyard, some one touched him on the shoulder.
He turned, and found himself looking into
Peter Swartz’s face. The soldier gave a significant jerk of
the head, closed one eye, and lounged casually in the direction
of the doorway opening on the garden. The courtyard
was full of men who had been cooking and eating their
supper; one side of it had been turned into a stable; the
south-east corner had become a kitchen where a huge fire
blazed. The men lay about on piles of bracken, their arms
hanging from wooden pegs that had been driven into the
wall. There seemed to be an abundance of ale. One of the
women from Gawdy Town was sitting on a saddle and
singing to the men, while she thrummed her lute. Martin
had to pass close to her, and she looked at him insolently
and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin followed Swartz into the garden. The place was
so wild and overgrown and tangled that no one troubled
to enter it, save when there was a reason for lying concealed.
Swartz was waiting by the yews near the sundial,
and Martin joined him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A word with you, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were restless and alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come this way, under the nut trees. Those sluts are
still at supper, and not looking for dark corners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pushed into the tunnel of leaves and stood listening.
Then Swartz began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Forest is full of swine, and I go elsewhere. Look
to yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jerked a thumb toward the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swine! I know the nature of the beasts. If I stayed
here a day longer I should have my throat slit, just to make
matters certain. Dead men need not be watched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew Martin close to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard yourself, my friend; the pigs do not love you. If
you are wise you will come with me and leave these gentry
to be hunted by my Lord of Troy. Thunder, but what a
man-at-arms I could make of you! In France and in Italy
a good sword wins much gold; they offer you a gay life,
plenty of wine, and honor to be won. These English have
no souls; they are all butchers and brewers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked into Martin’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What say you? Would she come also? Three comrades
in arms! I have money on me; you can buy any ship-master,
and he will sail you to hell or heaven. Come—what
do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s answer showed on his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swartz, no man has been more brotherly to me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damnation, man, I have a sort of foolish liking for you.
Good men are rare, men who can fight, and throw the
whole world over for a bit of honor. And here they are
ready to play some foul trick on you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swartz—I cannot come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not, man? If——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a doom here to work out; I feel it in my blood.
Nor would she go—as yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; the word would come from her—if it ever came.
I stay here, on guard, her man-at-arms. I have set myself
on this path, and I shall not leave it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz knew his man, and that he was not to be persuaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One word. I shall make for Gawdy Town; I shall lie
there for seven days; if your mind changes you will find
Swartz at a tavern near the harbor, at the sign of the
‘Crossed Keys.’ Much may happen in seven days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gripped hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look to yourself, Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are things a man never forgets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tush! I have the soul of a soldier. Remember the
‘Crossed Keys.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Martin Valliant went to his post that night outside
the door of Mellis’s room he found a drunken man
trying to open her door. It was barred on the inside, but
the fellow was fumbling with the latch, sottishly enraged
and babbling oaths. Martin took him by the shoulder, sent
him rolling down the stairs, and followed to see whether
he betrayed any desire to return. The man went down the
newel stairway with absurd contortions, like a beetle rolling
over and over and kicking as he rolled. He gathered
himself up at the bottom, clasped his head between his
hands, and disappeared unsteadily through the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin returned to the landing outside Mellis’s room,
and stood listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice answered him from the other side of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here. What has happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. A clown had lost his way, and I showed it to
him with some briskness. These knights and gentlemen
keep but poor order among their men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear lady!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a feeling of strange restlessness to-night. I know
not what ails me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is there to fear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with calmness, but her voice had made him
think of a wind blowing sadly in the distant woods at
night, plaintive and forlorn. His own heart was heavy in
him with deep foreboding, though he would not confess
to it before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is John Falconer in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One friend, please God. Where is Swartz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin hesitated, and then gave her the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Escaped—or on the verge of it. He does not trust to
promises—fears to be treated as a traitor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! he is right. Martin, I have come by a most evil
fear of my own people; their eyes do not look straight into
mine. That man, Sir Gregory, is no friend of ours. Oh, I
know; we women are quick. I feel a shadow over us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her move the bar that closed the door, and the
rustling of her dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shadow is mine,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was passion in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the evil in the hearts of other men. I feel it—feel
it like a fog creeping into my window. And I loved this
place; we were so happy, even though death was near; I
was not afraid. But now—a dread of something seizes me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bar was in her hands, and the door moved so that
Martin saw a little streak of light. His heart seemed to
stand still, and then beat like the heart of a man who is
afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is danger for you—there. They might creep up
while you are sleeping. Oh! what am I saying, what is this
dread that makes me a coward? But I am not a coward,
and I love you. See—you can sleep here, across my door,
so that no one can touch you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw the door open, and the gray light from her
room fell upon his face. She was all shadow, wrapped in
a cloak that had been found for her—a vague, soft outline
that seemed to yearn toward him, a dream begotten of the
night, tender, mysterious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there pride between us, and no sweet faith? Am I
asking you to do a shameful thing? Why, this is no more
than a simple room, where I breathe and move—and sleep.
I have a great fear for you to-night; I want you near me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, would you shame me, hold aloof as though I
had tempted you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught his hands, and drew them from his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I am wounded—if you have no faith!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—wounded, to the heart! Oh! my dear love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted her hands and kissed them almost fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be as you wish. This room is a chapel, its altar—where
you sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was over the threshold, and freeing a hand, she
softly closed the door. Her breath came quickly, with a
flutter of exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear lord, my man, is this not a great sacrament
between us? Now—you have made me happy; is it not
strange? See—you will lie here; there is bracken, and I will
spread it; and here—is a wallet for a pillow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glided about the room with innocent joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Set your sword there. Now, we are in our castle, and I
have no fear. Shall we pray, kneel down like children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught his hand, and they knelt down side by side.
Their prayers were said in silence, such prayers as save this
world of ours from the doom that it has earned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started up suddenly, took his face between her
hands, and kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear heart, good-night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis stretched herself on the bed, and Martin went to
his couch of bracken by the door. Neither of them spoke
again, but they lay awake for a long while, listening to each
other’s breathing.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXV</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant was asleep when a man
crawled up the stairs, groped his way to the closed
door, lay there a moment listening, and then
crawled back by the way he had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of figures showed black about a fire that had
been lit in the center of the roofless hall. John Falconer
was there, sullen, heavy-eyed—a man who found no pleasure
in looking at his own thoughts; also Sir Gregory, skull-faced
and ominous, with blue eyes that stared. A hot posset
was going around in a big tankard. These gentlemen had
but little to say to one another; they were waiting; the case
had been heard, and judgment given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who had gone a-spying up the tower came and
stood before Sir Gregory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The priest is not this side of the door, lording.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer’s sullen eyes seemed to catch the light of
the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See for yourself, Master Falconer. What’s more, he is
asleep across the door, for I could hear a sound of breathing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A grim laugh went around the fire. Ironical looks were
thrown at Falconer, who was frowning and biting his
beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Gregory spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such insolence must be chastened; we must be rid of
this bastard. Hallo, there! Axes for the breaking of a door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little man with a sallow face and bright black eyes
stood forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The room has a window, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Breaking the door is a clumsy device, and this Valliant
is desperate strong. Why not use the window, gentlemen,
and crawl in upon him while he is asleep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most excellent! But will God give us a ladder twenty
feet long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need for a ladder. Strain a stout rope over
the battlement so that it runs in front of the window, and
men can slide down the rope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well thought of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer appeared to rouse himself from a sort of
stupor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, gentlemen. Let no violence be done this man.
He has served us, and will suffer for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you, John Falconer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him be taken, mastered, stripped of his harness
and his arms, and turned out into the woods. His blood
should not be upon our hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plausible, very plausible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stand for that—or nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Gregory chuckled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my soul, such a punishment is better than blows.
There is a certain subtlety about it. I put my seal to the
document. Some one fetch the rope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work was done noiselessly by men who crept about
on bare feet, and without as much as a whisper. John
Falconer and a dozen of his own fellows were ready on
the stairs. Four men were to slide down the rope, enter
by the window, and while three of them fell upon Martin
Valliant, the fourth was to unbar the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature willed it that Mellis and her man should sleep
heavily that night, solaced by the innocent sweetness of
being so near each other, so full of a happy faith in their
great love. They slept like children, Mellis on her bed,
Martin lying across the door, his arms folded, his naked
sword beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He woke to a cry from Mellis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin! Guard yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last man to enter by the window had slipped on the
sill, and blundered against the man in front of him; and
Mellis, opening her eyes, had seen him outlined dimly
against the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her warning came too late. The fellows had thrown
themselves on Martin before he could rise, and had
dragged him from the door. One of them pulled out the
bar, and threw the door open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shouted to those on the stairs, and Falconer’s voice
took up the cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Torches—torches! Forward! Up with you, and follow
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had slipped out of bed and was trying to find the
sword that Martin had brought her out of the vault. She
could hear men struggling in the room, but the light was
too dim for her to see what was passing. A horror of helplessness
seized her; she shrank back against the wall, with
her hands pressed to her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help, there—help!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had broken free and was on his feet. One man
lay writhing with a bone in his throat broken; another had
been thrown against the wall and stunned. Martin had another
fellow lying bent across his knees and was choking
him, while the fourth man clung to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Falconer and his torches came up the stairs; the
doorway filled with smoke and glare and steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden palsy seemed to strike all the players in that
tragedy. Valliant let go of the man whom he was throttling,
while the fellow who had been clinging to Martin’s
ankles squirmed away toward the door. Martin stood motionless,
like a wrestler touched by enchantment and
turned into a statue; Mellis, her hands to her ears, her eyes
two great black circles, leaned against the wall; Falconer,
with torch and sword in the doorway, held back the men
who were behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s sword lay close to Mellis’s bed. His eyes looked
at it, but he did not move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Falconer spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin Valliant, no harm is meant you. Leave the
sword lying there; it will not avail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis’s lips moved, but no sound came from them. She
moved forward into the room, and her eyes were on John
Falconer’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Traitor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mouth twitched; he looked at Martin, and passed
her over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valliant, we captains have sworn not to keep you as
one of us. It is our right to choose; we have our reasons.
No harm shall be done you; you shall go out into the
Forest—as you came from it. Take your life, man; this
room is no place for you, and no place for brawls and
violence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s face was gray and haggard. The muscles stood
out like cords in his throat, and he drew his breath
heavily. He gave one glance at Mellis, and moved suddenly
toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Explicit,” he said, crossing his hands upon his chest.
“God have mercy on us all, John Falconer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men seized him and hurried him down the stairway,
nor did he resist. In the courtyard they stripped him
of his armor, leaving him nothing but his old cassock, a
girdle and a knife. He was taken across the bridge and
through the camp to the beech wood. A knight in black
harness was waiting there, leaning on his sword. One of the
men gave Martin a wallet full of food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight—it was Sir Gregory—went close to Martin,
and stared into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us not see you again,” he said. “Go—and take your
shame and your sin away from us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed with his sword into the gloom of the
beeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show your face again, and there shall be no mercy for
you, you thing of evil omen. Go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Martin Valliant went from them into the darkness
like a broken man carrying a curse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>John Falconer had cleared the men from the room, and
set his torch in a rusty bracket on the wall, where it threw
a wayward, draughty flare upon his face. Mellis stood by
the window with her back turned to him, rigid, motionless,
her hands at her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will come a time when you will thank me for
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was struggling for self-mastery, and against the
bitter shame that they had thrust upon her, while her heart
had gone out into the darkness with Martin Valliant, and
in a way she was desperate, robbed of her love. She might
have come through her anguish in silence had John Falconer
been less of a dull and jealous fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now get you to bed, child; there will be peace in this
house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flashed around on him with generous fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace—for me, when you have treated me as though I
were a harlot? Oh, you blind fools, you souls full of foul
imaginings! That man was a saint, white as God’s own
self. And you have robbed me of such a love as a man but
seldom gives to a woman. Yes, he could have taken that
sword and given death to many of your curs, but there
was a nobleness, a humility, that did not touch you. He
knew what was in your hearts, that you hated him, were
jealous, breathed foul lies. He besought me to let him go.
And I—I bade him stay. I would that he had taken all
that a woman has to give; yes, my very body and soul.
There is the truth; I fling it in your face, John Falconer,
you sour and godly and grudging hound!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her anger scorched him like a flame. He answered her
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was for your sake I did it. For you are precious
to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sake! Ye gods! Is a woman’s love to be put in
pawn by gray fools and wiseacres? I tell you I am his; I
shall die his; I would that he had taken all that I had to
give. And I am precious to you? Never, by my soul! I cast
you off! I am your enemy henceforth, and every man here
is my mortal foe. May disaster befall you all! May you be
cut off, slain, trampled into the earth! Get you gone out
of this room; my love has slept here, and you do foul it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She advanced on him, and he went back before her,
covering his face with his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will thank me—yet,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, I shall die before I thank you,” and she closed the
door on him as he went out.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXVI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had fallen into great darkness
of soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Forest lay about him, vast, silent, and
mysterious; the sky was overclouded, and the moon obscured;
and life seemed like the Forest, all black and without
a purpose, a wilderness where wild beasts wandered
and outcast men hid themselves from the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while he wandered about among the beech trees
like a blind man who had lost his way, for in very truth
he was blind of soul, so smitten through with anguish that
he could neither think nor pray. A stupor gripped him, a
stupor of misery and helplessness. It was as though a great
hand had swept down and put out the white light that
had burned within him; blackness, nothingness, remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he went to and fro under the great trees, Martin
Valliant struggled to break through this human anguish
and all this coil and tumult of loving and being loved. He
tried to stand as his old self, calm, patient, gentle, a
watcher of other men’s lives. Things had been so quietly
ordered in the old days; nothing had been able to master
him, to send him like a blown leaf whirling with the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now—what had happened? Was God mocking him,
or had he been cheated by the devil? Who was God, and
who was the devil? What was this thing that men called
sin? Was life only a huge fable, a piece of tapestry, behind
which lay the burning, passionate reality, the being and
becoming, the great glowing flux of fire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fell on his knees and clasped his head between his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who was calling him, and why did his heart answer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis! Mellis! Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in the darkness, she was among the stars, in the
leaves of the trees, in the stillness of the night. She was
light and shadow, sound and silence, colors and perfumes;
she held the round world in her hands, and heaven was
behind her eyes. He loved her, and her love was his. Where
was the sin? Where was the shame?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin made a cloister of the beech wood all that night,
pacing up and down between the black boles, sometimes
lying prone in the dead leaves or the bracken. He saw
nothing but Mellis—Mellis white and speechless, stretching
out her hands to him, looking at him with eyes of
anguish. She was a white flame burning in the darkness,
and he could see nothing, think of nothing but her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dame Nature, Mother of all the gods, led Martin to
the deep waters and showed him in their blackness the
image of a woman. And into these waters a man must cast
himself naked, madman and rebel, leaving his manifold
hypocrisies behind him, stripped of the shreds and the
patchwork and the cap of the moral fool. Before dawn
came Martin Valliant had taken that great plunge. He
was a rebel, naked and unashamed, most bitterly refusing
to surrender the great thing that was his, and ready to
fight for it with savage fierceness against saints and devils,
priests and men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the first grayness of the dawn Martin turned his
face toward Woodmere, and stealing from tree to tree,
worked his way slowly through the beech wood. There
were no more than three or four great trees left between
him and the open sky, and he could see the mere lying
in the valley and the tower where Mellis had slept; the
birds were singing; the camp still seemed asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something whirred past him and struck the trunk of a
tree away on his left, and Martin threw himself flat, for
he knew that a cross-bow bolt had been loosed at him.
Though he raised his head cautiously, and peered about
him, he could see nothing but the bracken below, the
green gloom of the branches above, the great gray trunks
standing like the pillars of a church. But the man who had
fired the shot could still see Martin. A second bolt whizzed
over his head and buried itself in the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run, you dog! Off with you, or the next shot shall be
in your body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice came from the fork of a tree, and Martin was
shrewd enough to believe in the man’s sincerity. He
sprang up, and dashed back into the deeps of the wood,
furious at the thought that Falconer had set men to watch
for him. He tried another part of the wood, but with no
better luck. This time an arrow from a long bow drove
into the ground within a yard of his feet, warning him
that he was shadowed and that the Forest’s eyes were wide
awake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin took the lesson to heart, and turned back sullenly
into the deeps of the wood. His wits were at work,
offering him all manner of wild hazards, and the more
desperate and foolish they seemed, the more bitter and
dogged grew his resolution. He passed through the beech
wood, crossed a stretch of open grassland, and plunged
into a thicket of hollies that trailed down from the slopes
of an oak-covered hill. Once under cover, he stood at gaze
to see if he had been followed, and his shrewdness had its
reward. A man in a doublet of Lincoln green showed himself
for a moment on the edge of the beech wood, scanned
the grassland, and then turned back into the woodshade
as though he had no liking for following such a wild dog
any farther.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin cut northwards into the oak wood where the
trees stood well apart, with no scrub growing between
them, their trunks rising from the green turf. He went at
the double, keeping well in among the trees, bearing westwards
along the hill that bounded Woodmere valley in
the north. His need of a weapon asserted itself, for he had
nothing but his knife, and coming across a young holly
growing straight and clean, he felled it after five minutes’
hacking with his knife. With its boughs and top trimmed
off, it made a heavy and notable club, and he went on with
it on his shoulder, and in a temper that boded ill for any
man who should give him battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took Martin Valliant the best part of an hour to cast
a half circle around Woodmere valley and approach it
from the other side. A hazel copse proved friendly; he
crawled into it, and plowed his way cautiously through
the green cloud of branches. The copse ended in a great
bank of furze that poured down the hillside like a flood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had the whole valley spread before him,
all wet and washed with the morning’s dew, the sunlight
slanting down on it with the calm beauty of a summer
morning. Smoke rose straight and blue from the camp
fires; the mere shone like glass; the tower, with its lichen-stained
walls, was the color of gold. But if the woods and
the valley breathed peace, man plotted war, and all the
green hill beyond the water was astir with men running
to arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer and the Forest lords were preparing to march.
Each captain was rallying his company, and there was
much shouting and hurrying to and fro. The swarm of
figures in their reds and greens, russets and blues, sorted
themselves and gathered to their pennons and banners like
a pattern of flowers. There were the archers, with bows on
their backs, and bills in their hands; the common crowd
of footmen with their pikes, partisans, scythes, axes, and
oak cudgels; the gentry and their servants mounted and
sheathed in steel, their lances rising straight and close
together like pine trees in a wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant marked a little group of riders sitting
their horses apart from the rest. They numbered about
twenty lances, and a man in the midst of them carried a
banner of blue and green. The sunlight splintered itself
on their harness; they looked big men and stoutly armed,
chosen for a purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two riders were crossing the grassland from the direction
of the mere, and Martin Valliant’s eyes filled with a
hungry, yearning light as he watched them. One was a
woman, the other a man. The woman was distinguishable
by her hair, that hung loose upon the suit of light harness
that she wore, and by the cloak or apron of green fastened
about her waist. She rode a white horse. The man, John
Falconer, had her bridle over his arm. She was a prisoner.
The twenty lances were to serve as her guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant knelt and watched her, leaning on his
holly staff, his eyes shining like steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trumpets blew. A swarm of archers and mounted
men went scattering into the beech wood and were swallowed
up by its shadows. The massed “foot” began to
move in columns, like fat, brightly colored caterpillars
crawling up the hill. The gentlemen and men-at-arms followed,
with jogging spears and a glittering of harness. Last
of all rode John Falconer, Mellis, and her guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant sprang up, and held his staff aloft as
though challenging them. Then he turned back into the
woods, a divine madman hunting an army.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXVII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Gregory’s scouts had been watching Troy
Castle, and my Lord of Troy’s spies had had their
eyes on Woodmere. Both parties were kept well
victualed with news; but Sir Gregory was no better than
a round-headed butcher, a mere bullying, blasting Englishman,
ever ready to think his enemy a fool; whereas Roger
Bland had an Italian shrewdness and an imagination that
made him something of a coward. A clever coward is worth
any number of bull-headed fools. And in this game of
hide-and-seek my Lord of Troy was too subtle and too
cunning for the Foresters. He saw to it that they had false
news, and no real knowledge of the power that he could
bring against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scouts had galloped back to Woodmere, greatly exulting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Troy is on the march. Fifty archers and a hundred
men-at-arms. They have cannon with them. We can eat
them up, lordings all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the news, and the Forest captains rose to it,
and set their trumpets blowing. But Roger Bland was no
such facile fool. Sir Gregory’s scouts had watched Troy
Castle, and the roads leading to it; they had reported
faithfully, counted their men with honest precision, accurately
judged the enemy’s strength. Yet no one appeared
to remember that there might be another cloud in the sky,
hidden from them by the tree-tops and the hills. My Lord
of Troy had blundered, belittled the forces against him!
He had marched out and camped for the night on Bracknell
Plain with his cannon and a hundred and fifty men.
That was how Sir Gregory and his captains viewed it, and
they rushed out to attack my Lord of Troy, meaning to
catch him on the march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roger Bland had not hurried himself. He was still
camped on Bracknell Plain, though the sun had been up
some hours. And that camp of his was very cunningly
placed, with three great open woods sending out leafy
capes within a quarter of a mile of it, good cover for an
ambuscade. His camp had a rampart of brushwood and
sharp stakes; his cannon were loaded and ready, the gunners
lying beside them; his archers squatted behind the brushwood;
gentlemen and men-at-arms were in full harness and
ready to mass their spears. The horses were tethered outside
the camp, half a furlong away; a sharp look-out was
being kept. My Lord of Troy had baited his trap and sat
down to wait for his prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a league and a half from Woodmere to the edge
of Bracknell Plain, and Sir Gregory had halted his companies
under cover of a heathy hill and waited for his riders
to come in. John Falconer had the rear-guard, and Sir
Gregory jogged back to speak with him, and to look with
lustful eyes at a woman who was very beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We should have good news, John. And how doth our
sweet Mistress like the morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis had dismounted and was sitting in the heather,
white, dark-eyed, and sullen, holding herself proudly because
of these men and of the shame they had put upon
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not look at Sir Gregory, or answer him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut, tut! Our sweet comrade is still wroth with us,
John. Women are unreasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falconer growled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the wench be! We have flayed her pride, and she
hates us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A squire, very hot and dusty, came cantering down on
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“News, sir—news!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord of Troy is still camped on Bracknell Plain.
They have not stirred, sir. Their horses are unharnessed,
their sentries pushed out no farther than a furlong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye gods! This Roger Bland was never a soldier. Why,
we shall be on them before they can get to horse. Come,
sirs, come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away in the woods Martin Valliant was seeing strange
things. He had followed the march of Sir Gregory’s men
from Woodmere, and when they had reached the rolling
heaths that led up to Bracknell Plain, he had drawn away
among the pine thickets so that he could watch them
without being seen. His course had led him toward one of
those strips of woodland that jutted out into the plain
toward my Lord of Troy’s camp, an open wood of beeches
and Scots firs. The place seemed silent and empty, full of
deep shadows and splashes of sunlight that played on the
bracken and the trunks of the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then of a sudden he saw something that made him
drop down in the bracken like a bird when a hawk is
hovering overhead. A knight in armor was riding his horse
through the wood. He reined in and remained motionless,
spear on thigh, red plume trailing under the branches. He
wore a red tabard embroidered with gold; his horse’s harness
was of red leather studded with brass; his spear was
painted black, and a bunch of white roses had been tied to
its throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin, lying flat on his belly, grew aware of a strange,
tremulous stirring in the deeps of the wood. It was as
though some great monster were moving, ponderous and
slow, the earth and the trees quivering as it moved. There
was a shrilling of steel and the snorting of horses. The
knight in the red tabard held up his spear, and the wood
seemed to grow silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had blundered into the midst of a mystery. He
crawled backwards through the bracken, keeping his eyes
on the knight in the red tabard; but that gentleman was
staring through a woodland window out upon Bracknell
Plain, and Martin Valliant escaped unseen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay for a while in a little dell, resting his chin on his
hands, and staring at the seed pods of the wild hyacinths
that had carpeted the ground. The wood remained silent,
save for the screaming of a couple of jays, yet Martin
guessed that the red knight was no solitary adventurer, but
the leader of a great company that was lying hidden among
the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What of Sir Gregory and the men of the Red Rose?
Were they pushing blindly into an ambush, and if so—what
would come of it? A grim impartiality guided Martin’s
thoughts; he cared not which beast devoured the
other, provided Mellis was not harmed; he was a thief
ready to snatch the precious plunder while these gentry
fought. The inspiration was obvious, and stirred him to
action. He crawled to the edge of the wood, followed it
southwards for a short distance, chose a tall fir, and
swarmed up it, leaving his club lying in the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tree forked above thirty feet from the ground, and
Martin wriggled up and out along one of the limbs till
he was part of the pine needles, like a crow in its nest.
The fir gave him a superb view. He could see nearly the
whole of Bracknell Plain, my Lord of Troy’s camp, even
Sir Gregory’s troops massed in the hollow behind the hill.
This live map puzzled him for a moment; he was thinking
of the red knight in the wood, a sinister figure, the wizard
who could conjure forth a dragon of steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had his eyes on Sir Gregory’s forces, when he
saw one of the columns push forward up the hill with a
scattering of dark figures running on ahead. Sir Gregory
was sending on his archers to sow arrows and disorder in
my lord’s sluggish camp. The gentry and men-at-arms followed
at a walk, moving on the farther side of the footmen,
and ready to break into a charge when the archers
had done their work. Last of all came Mellis’s guard, a
knot of steel-clad figures with Falconer and Mellis in the
midst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin turned his eyes on my Lord of Troy’s camp. It
looked amazingly still and unconcerned, the sentries standing
to their arms in the midst of the heather. This carelessness
seemed astonishing to the man who was watching
those armed masses surging up the blind side of the
hill. But the very foolishness of that seemingly casual
camp flashed the meaning of it all into Martin Valliant’s
mind. It was not my Lord of Troy who was in dire peril,
but those hot heads who were streaming to the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For many a year the Forest had good cause to remember
the battle of Bracknell Plain. It began with the rush
of Sir Gregory’s archers over the hill, and a rattling shower
of arrows into my Lord of Troy’s camp. Yet these arrows
did but little damage, for the White Rose bowmen had
thrown up a wall of sods behind the line of brushwood
and were lying under cover, while the heavily armed
knights and gentry could trust in their harness. The foresters
fired flight after flight of arrows into the camp,
shouting and leaping like madmen, for not an arrow shot
came in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Gregory, who rode over the hill with his men-at-arms,
saw his archers shooting furiously, and heard them
cheering as though the victory were won. He did not
pause to consider the question, but thinking my Lord of
Troy’s men too panic-stricken even to run to their horses,
he set his riders at the gallop and charged down upon the
camp. His footmen were to follow and to end the business
when he and his “spears” had broken in and scattered the
enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Martin saw puffs of blue smoke belch out from
behind the brushwood, and heard the roar of my lord’s
cannon. The archers sprang to their feet and poured a
flight of arrows into the charging “horse.” The cannon
shot tore into the mass; the arrows struck the horses. A
great confusion followed, as of a wave of water meeting a
wall; horses and men were down; the whole company faltered,
broke, tangled itself into a whirl of disorder. Arrows
came stinging down on them, for the shooting was fast
and easy so far as my Lord of Troy’s archers were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thunder of hoofs in the wood behind him, a screaming
of trumpets, and out galloped the red knight with a
torrent of steel at his back. The charge was superb, terrible,
carried out like a whirlwind. It bore down on Sir
Gregory’s disorder, crashed through and over it, wheeled,
and headed for the mass of footmen who had halted in
a palsied crowd on the edge of the plain. My lord’s
archers and footmen were running out to complete the
overthrow of Sir Gregory’s horse, to cut throats and to
take prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The battle was over in twenty minutes; it became a wild
slaughter, a scattering of death and despair over Bracknell
Plain. Sir Gregory’s “foot” had turned and run, throwing
down their weapons as they fled over the heather. And
Martin Valliant had come swarming down his tree, picked
up his club, and started to run toward the rout as though
he had lost his senses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen John Falconer and his men-at-arms halt on
the open plain and stand watching the battle as though it
was neither their business to fight nor to fly. None the
less, the disastrous issue had pricked their consciences;
they had moved forward tentatively, faltered, and thought
better of such heroism; moreover, they had a prize to
guard, and John Falconer had kept his head. But fate
and Fulk de Lisle did not will it that they should escape
the slaughter on Bracknell Plain, and Martin had seen the
red knight and some fifty of his lances wheel and gallop
down on Mellis’s guards. De Lisle’s men opened out and
enveloped the little group before it could escape over the
edge of the plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the reason of Martin Valliant’s madness and
his wild dash across the heather. Fortune was with him in
a sense, for he came through the butchery and the turmoil
without being struck down by my Lord of Troy’s men.
There was a space of calmness between the main rout and
the fight that was going on between John Falconer and
De Lisle, but the tussle was over before Martin drew near.
Falconer lay dying from a spear thrust through the body;
his men were down or had surrendered; De Lisle’s riders
tossed their spears and cheered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Martin saw a sight that made him stand stone
still and set his teeth. The group of steel-coated figures
parted, and from the midst of them came riding the red
knight, leading a white horse by the bridle. Martin Valliant
saw Mellis drooping in the saddle, her hair falling
over her face, her hands hanging as though she despaired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red knight did not turn toward my lord’s camp,
but rode calmly away over the plain toward the woods in
the distance. No one followed him or the woman on the
white horse. His men knew that Fulk de Lisle was not to
be meddled with when he followed the chase and the
game was a stag or a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant started running again, his face all white
and twisted. But a certain cunning saved him from throwing
his life and his hope away. He doubled sharply under
the brow of the hill, caught a riderless horse that was
standing nosing the heather, mounted, and urged the beast
to a canter, keeping to the lower ground out of sight of
the riders from Troy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he was well clear he turned upwards on to Bracknell
Plain, the reins in one hand, his hollywood staff in
the other. The white horse and the red tabard showed a
mile away over the heather, and Martin followed them
with the grimness of death.</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXVIII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle rode for a mile without troubling
to glance back. He was in great good humor, and trying
to raise some color in the face of the girl beside
him. She looked dazed, beaten, her eyes empty of all light,
her hands gripping the pommel of her saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why so sad, sweet mistress? Am I not as good a man
as any fellow yonder, and better than our friend the monk?
I have won you on a fair field.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes glanced at him with furtive dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know not who you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put up his vizor and she knew him by his eyes, bold,
brown, and merciless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her frank horror angered him, and he reached out and
twisted his hand into her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Shall I have to tame you, teach you what manner
of man I am? What others have had I will have also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her pride rose at his challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go, or I will throw myself out of the saddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And be dragged by the hair, my shrew! No, no; such
tricks will not serve. I have taken my prize, and this time
I shall not be balked of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew her own helplessness, and constrained herself
to try other weapons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go. You are hurting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the fault mine? Smile at me, you jade, and look
not so sick and passionless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She contrived to smile, hating him the more for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better—much better. Why, I have taught many
women to love me, but love does not last, wench; that is
why men should marry for a month and no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let her go, and glancing back over his shoulder, he
reined in with sudden fierceness. The white horse, checked
so roughly, swerved and showed temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand still, you beast! Hallo! what have we here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis saw what Fulk de Lisle saw, and her face flamed
like a sunset. Martin Valliant had drawn up to within a
quarter of a mile of them, but he was holding his horse
in and following them with a certain grim leisureliness.
This eastern part of Bracknell Plain was an utter wilderness;
they had left victory and defeat far behind; nothing
moved over the heather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle caught a glimpse of Mellis’s face with its
shining eyes and its rich rush of tenderness. The droop
had gone out of her figure, and her throat had regained
its pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed with malicious insolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this, my lady? A beggar in a black smock? I
am in no temper to give alms to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spurred on his horse, and jerked Mellis along with
him. It was his spear that had broken itself in John
Falconer’s body, and he felt to see that his sword was loose
in its scabbard. Mellis noticed the act, and smiled strangely.
Ahead of them towered the fir woods of Amber Holt, dark
and silent, like a great green cloud across the blue. Dense
gloom lay behind the tall straight trunks, and bracken
foamed at their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced back over her shoulder, and realized that
Martin had no harness. He had drawn nearer, and she
could see that he carried some sort of weapon on his
shoulder. Fear for him darkened her eyes. What chance
had he, a naked man, against this steel-coated swashbuckler
with his sword and dagger?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hated Fulk de Lisle—hated him with such intensity
that he turned his head sharply and met her eyes. Even
his vanity could not misread the look in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So! Madame has a tender heart? You white-bosomed
jade!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew the white horse in, hooked an arm around her
neck, and forced her face close to his helmet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look in my eyes, wench. Yes, our friend can see this
pretty picture. If he meddles with me I shall kill him;
somewhere over yonder in the fir woods. Then we shall
be alone together, you and I, and you will give me all that
I desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She strained away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beast! Be not so sure!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—a fool of a monk with a club! I know that sort
of clumsy savage. It will be mere murder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she would not betray her fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have it so. Strange things happen—even to kings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin saw all this, and his wrath blew like a north
wind. He had guessed the name of the red knight and
knew the man with whom he had to deal. It would be
no easy business, setting about this notable sworder and
captain with nothing but a green holly stake, but somehow
Martin had no doubts as to how the battle would
end. His cold fury was so intense and so fanatical that it
resembled a fate that was not to be stayed or turned back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle and Mellis were nearing the fir woods,
and Martin put his horse at a canter and drew up within
fifty yards. De Lisle had no spear; that was something in
Martin’s favor, though his long sword would be deadly
enough in so strong and cunning a hand. Martin had a
shrewd notion as to how he ought to fight the man; if he
could dismount him and get to close grips De Lisle’s
heavy armor would make him clumsy and slow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shadows of the firs swept over them, and they were
in among the crowded trunks, riding down a narrow track
that seemed to lose itself in the distant gloom. Martin
drew closer, teeth set, his heavy truncheon ready on his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle turned in the saddle and looked back at
him. He had drawn his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend, be warned in time. Turn back, or I shall
kill you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin said never a word, but drew closer, his eyes shining
in a dead-white face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Lisle had every advantage, but there was a woman
at his side, and he did not respect her courage or her
hatred as he should have done. The white horse was close
to his, and of a sudden Mellis twisted sideways, threw
her arms about De Lisle’s body, and held to him
desperately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin kicked his heels into his horse’s flanks, leaning
forward and swinging his club. De Lisle had got an arm
around Mellis’s body. He dragged her around on to his
knees, struck her savagely in the breast with the pommel
of his sword, and flung her down under her horse’s feet.
He brought his horse around just as Martin charged him,
and gave his enemy the point; but Martin had been waiting
for such a trick, and slipping down under his horse’s
flank, he let Fulk’s blade gash his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own horse blundered into De Lisle’s and staggered
the other beast. Martin slipped clear, and got in a blow
that made the swashbuckler reel in the saddle. De Lisle
struck back at him, and Martin, guarding, had his staff
cut clean in two. He sprang in and up, got a grip of
Fulk’s swordbelt and wrist, and dragged him out of the
saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Lisle’s sword flew out of his hand, and the two men
lay struggling like wild beasts under the horses’ hoofs.
De Lisle’s harness bit into Martin’s flesh, his spurs gashed
him, but Martin felt no pain. The fight was for the swashbuckler’s
poniard, already half drawn from its sheath.
Martin came uppermost, one hand gripping De Lisle’s
wrist, the other thrust under the vizor of his helmet. De
Lisle struck at him furiously with his gadded glove, and
then tried to tear Martin’s hand away from his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Martin was too strong for him; he had lived a
cleaner life, and his muscles won in the tense balance of
such a struggle. Neither man seemed to move for half a
minute, both bodies rigid, straining against each other.
Then De Lisle’s hand was jerked from the handle of his
poniard, and Martin had clutched it and drawn it from
its sheath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulk de Lisle knew what was coming. He rolled to and
fro, lashed out with his mailed fists, tore at Martin with
his spurs; but his heavy harness cumbered him, and his
breath was gone. Martin struck three times at the man’s
gorget before the plates gave, and the poniard drove deep
into the swashbuckler’s throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two more such blows, and Fulk de Lisle twitched, gave
a wet cry, and lay still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin struggled up, panting, battered, running with
blood. He looked around for Mellis. She had been leaning
against a tree trunk, her hands clasping her bruised bosom,
watching that death struggle with eyes that saw love and
life fighting for her and for her honor. Her man was
wounded. He would need her now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran to him, eyes full of soft lights and shadows,
pitying his wounds, and not shrinking from his bloodiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin! Oh, brave heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught his face between her hands and kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there ever so fine a man as mine? And your
wounds, your poor shoulder! Now it is that my hands can
be of use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made him lie down at the foot of a tree, spreading
her own cloak for him. Her horse carried saddle-bags, so
did Fulk de Lisle’s, and the two beasts were nosing each
other as though to protest that a man’s quarrel was not
theirs. Mellis took them by the bridles and tied them to
a tree, unstrapped the bags, and laid them on the grass.
In her own she found some clean linen, in Fulk de Lisle’s
a bottle of wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant lay on his back, white and faint, his
eyes staring dreamily at the flickering sunlight in the fir
boughs overhead. A great lassitude had fallen on him—a
sweet indolence. His manhood surrendered itself into the
hands of a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came and knelt by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now—your shoulder. That must be mended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had drawn the wooden spigot out of the stone
bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wine is clean and good. Lie still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wound was washed with red Bordeaux, wiped clean,
and swathed in the bandages torn from her piece of linen.
Then she raised Martin’s head and made him drink, looking
at him with eyes that glimmered mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught a strand of her hair and laid it against his
lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What more could a man ask of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled, and brushed her cheek against his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Martin sat up and looked about him, at the
dead man, the horses, his own ragged cassock, and his
spur-torn legs. They were burning as though he had fallen
into the fire, and he knew that his face had been cut by
the gads on De Lisle’s gloves. A pretty object he must look
to her, and yet her love was like a soft light around him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A swim in the Rondel would not come amiss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the wine and the rest of the linen from her,
and rising, went away among the trees. He bathed his
face with the wine, swathed his legs with the linen, and
put his hands ruefully through the rents in his cassock.
It seemed to be hanging by shreds, and his skin showed
in a dozen places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rejoined her, looking very solemn, but she was holding
up a rich red cloak that she had unstrapped from De
Lisle’s saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will serve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tossed it to him, and he flung it over his shoulders
and tied the laces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A new color.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And no ill color either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis picked up her own green cloak and fastened it
so that it made her look more of a woman. She blushed,
and gave Martin a shy, laughing glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This man’s gear does not please me. I shall have to
thieve or borrow. And, alas! all the world has gone against
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Lisle’s red figure lying there stark and still made
them remember the peril that threatened them. The Red
Rose was in the dust; the Forest was but a hunting
ground for my Lord of Troy and his riders; the gallows
at Troy Castle would bear deadly fruit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis’s eyes darkened, and her face lost some of its
soft, rounded light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help us! This has been an ill day for the Forest.
And yet—they were my enemies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stole a glance at Fulk’s body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go, dear comrade. We have no friends now—save
each other. How dark this wood is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where would you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! what a question! Where? Into the deep woods
with the wild things, and so somewhere where our faces
are not known. I would live a little while yet, Martin, for
life can be sweet—now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her strangely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; you are too beautiful to die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horse that Martin had ridden had wandered off into
the wood, but Fulk de Lisle’s was at his service. Moreover,
the dead man’s sword and dagger might have their
uses, and for the better carrying of them Martin took
Fulk’s belt and buckled it about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it not,” he said; “but necessity is our master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He helped Mellis to her saddle, unfastened the horses,
and mounted Fulk de Lisle’s. Then he hesitated, looking
into Mellis’s eyes, for he knew not where to turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On through the wood. Thanks be to God, I was born
in the Forest.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XXXIX</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis knew the ways, and through all the heat
of the day she guided Martin southwards toward
the Rondel river, picking up the wild tracks and
never faltering in her choice. They kept to the woods, and
avoided the open heaths, sometimes following a brown
stream that flickered under the green shadows and leaving
it when it left the woods. Not a living creature did they
see save a few deer far down a deep glade, a hawk searching
for food, and once, a gray-green snake basking on a
bank in the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gloom seemed to have fallen on the Forest, and even
the young foliage looked darker, heavier, less bright with
the freshness of spring. The open woods were full of a
listening sadness, a mysterious expectancy; for Death was
out, Death and the Lord of Troy. Yet Mellis was touched
by no such melancholy, no sinister forebodings; her man’s
life was in her hands, her eyes were keen and watchful;
danger gave a sparkle to her beauty; the day’s need steadied
her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant watched her, and marveled. He forgot
his wounds in looking at her forest-shaded face with its
clean, clear comeliness, its alert, proud self-trust. There
was nothing more wonderful than her eyes and the way
they filled with light when meeting his. Their color seemed
so elusive, changing from blue to black, and sometimes
they were all a-glimmer like water touched by the sun. He
looked at her lips, her white throat, her hair, the hands
that held the reins, and had to tell himself that she was
his. Every part of her seemed a piece of enchantment.
She was so fair in his eyes that the thought of touching
her seemed sacrilege.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found her smiling at him shyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we lost our tongues, dear man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much has happened, and you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I think that you do not belong to this
world, that you will vanish away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him intently, curiously, for it seemed to
her that his mood foreshadowed some solemn and subtle
fancy that was working in his heart. He desired her, and
yet did not desire her. The glamour of a mystical self-renunciation
was not dead in Martin Valliant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am flesh and blood, God be thanked for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He half closed his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see more than that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She colored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See the woman in me. For it is the man in you that
has made me dream dreams.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode in silence for a while, but both were conscious
of a listening tenderness, a mysterious and unsolved
unrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at her gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life and Death march on either side of us. We have
to take thought for to-morrow and to-morrow’s morrow.
It will not be easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw his eyes grow dark and deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor is life easy, child. I hold your soul in pledge, and
this place is full of our enemies. And what am I but a
broken man, an outcast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are my love,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not speak for a moment, and there were lines
on his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is God satisfied? Does He look on us as two children?
I could show Him my heart—without fear—and yet——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could die and not be afraid. But life is yours, and
the beauty and the sweetness thereof, and where is the
chalice for such wine? Are my hands fit to carry it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ask for no other hands. Let God judge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin rode at her side, sunk in deep thought. He had
not forgotten Peter Swartz and the inn of the Crossed
Keys at Gawdy Town. Life and liberty might lie that way,
escape from the vengeance of my Lord of Troy, and from
the curses of the brethren of Paradise; but it would be at
the cost of exile, of wanderings in a strange land. Was
Mellis made for such a life? Was not her very beauty too
rich and perilous? Moreover, all hope had not vanished
for her out of England; Richmond was on the seas; the
Red Rose might yet out-flower the White.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis was waiting on his meditations. Her mind was
most obstinately made up; she was no green child or the
victim of fanciful tenors; life had taught her much; the
rough wisdom begotten of her adventures had been wedded
to the sure instincts of the woman. Martin Valliant was
her man; he was strong, and could keep her from the
hands of other men, for she had no waywardness, no wish
to change her lovers. Some women are born to be courtesans,
but Mellis was not one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still thinking, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated, and then told her of Swartz, and the inn
at Gawdy Town. Her eyes brightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Swartz! Good comrade! Why, that is a plan
worth trying when matters look so desperate. The men
of Gawdy Town have no great love for my Lord of Troy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin looked at her in astonishment, for the brave
adventurousness of her face betrayed no fear of the
future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis. Have you considered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything. More than you can guess, dear lad. Why,
I am wiser than you are, and tougher in the ways of the
world. We should find ourselves in France, taking the
open road, sleeping in all manner of odd places, sometimes
begging, sometimes singing for pay. The great vagabond
life! But Swartz was right. Strong men soon jostle
free, get a higher seat than their fellows. I have wandered;
I know what can be done. Martin Valliant was born to
fight and to rule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she had not won him yet. His mystical love still
glimpsed self-sacrifice, renunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was before they came to the Rondel river that they
sighted a forester’s cottage in a deep hollow under the
woods. Mellis knew the place, and after scanning it awhile
turned her horse toward it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jeremy Marvel lived there—a good fellow. He may sell
us what we need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled at Martin’s blank face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I have a little money. I am quite shrewd, good sir.
I kept it under my bed at Woodmere, and a little money
is the best friend in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode down to the cottage and found it deserted,
for Jeremy Marvel had sent his wife and babes across the
river before marching to Woodmere with his bow. Martin
had to force the door, and Mellis abetted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The place will be burned or plundered, so let your conscience
be easy. And Jeremy had many a good thing from
my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their needs were simple, food and raiment, and they
found both. Mellis went smiling into the little bed-chamber,
and the great cupboard there gave a plain russet
gown, a hooded cloak, rough hose, and a pair of shoes.
She flung a green doublet and gray woolen hose out to
Martin, and shut herself into the good folks’ room. Fulk
de Lisle’s red cloak was stuffed up the stone chimney, and
Martin found one of brown kersey to replace it, hanging
on a nail beside an oak press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mellis came out to him she was the laughing
country wench in russet, her hair tied with a green ribbon,
her feet in rough shoes. Martin’s raiment kept hers company.
He had discovered a green cloth cap with a raven’s
feather stuck into it, and the thing hid that still too
obvious tonsure of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-day to you, Goodman Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her dearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine clothes do not make the woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is rank heresy, dear man; but if it contents you,
I will not complain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The larder gave them bread and honey, and Martin
went with a pitcher to the well. They sat down at Jeremy
Marvel’s table, and when they had ended the meal, Mellis
left a piece of silver there to quiet her own conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt whether it will ever reach the poor clown’s
pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Which was true, for Jeremy Marvel lay dead on Bracknell
Plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before they sallied Mellis took some linen from the
press for the dressing of Martin’s wounds. Moreover, a
loaf of bread was useful plunder, though Martin had found
bread and meat and half a spiced cake in Fulk de Lisle’s
saddle-bag. Mellis also insisted on his taking the pitcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sling it to your saddle. We may bless it to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was low in the west when they struck the
Rondel flowing between two broad stretches of wild grassland—grassland
that was all white with ox-eyed daisies.
They had to follow the river for a while, searching for a
ford where ruffled water marked the shallows. Mellis’s eyes
were watching for a cairn of stones that had been built by
a hermit a century ago to show the depth of the river in
winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed it out at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that I had not strayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stretch of sand below the bank was smooth and
unscarred; no one had crossed by that ford for many
days, and Mellis uttered a cry of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the nearest way to Gawdy Town, and we are
the first over. We shall be there before the news of Bracknell
Plain. That comes of being bred in these parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They splashed across, and let their horses drink before
climbing the farther bank. The grassland south of the river
rose in great green sweeps to touch the wild woods east of
Bloody Rood. A soft breeze sent patches of wavering green
moving over the silver of the feathered grass tops and the
flowers. Here and there a lark rose from its nest, or a plover
went wheeling and complaining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gradual silence had fallen on Martin Valliant. As the
sun sank low and the light grew more mysterious, his
mood seemed to deepen toward a passionate and wondering
mysticism. He saw Mellis in a glamor of gold, and his
love bent toward a solemn sadness. A deep pity for her
touched him—an infinite tenderness. She became for him
a symbol, a beautiful pure child too wonderful to be sacrificed
to the common life of the world. A new awe of her
stole over him, and he was afraid. What was he that he
should take her and her love? What could he offer her?
What had he to give? Surely she was not made for the
rough pilgrimage that might be his, and he could not
trade upon her generous courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, Martin Valliant fell to a sudden stroke of
superstition. Would he not carry a curse? And would not
Mellis be entangled in it? He might bring her a great
unhappiness, dim all the radiance of her youth and desire.
What right had he to join her life to his? There was such
a thing as “right of sanctuary”; he could lodge here in
some religious house where she would be safe till the times
proved themselves, and the land turned again to peace.
He would have been honest with her and with himself;
bitter wounds would heal; God could not say that he had
sinned against her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The green half-light of the woods seemed in sympathy
with this mood of his. He would not let himself look at
Mellis, for he was afraid to meet her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My man is weary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She challenged his silence, watching him with steady
eyes. But he would not confess to her, and she had to
puzzle out the meaning of his sudden melancholy. Mellis
asked no questions, grew silent in turn, nor was she long
in discovering to herself the thoughts and emotions that
troubled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she had foreseen this generous obstinacy of his,
counted on having to combat it, for women fly from hill
to hill while men labor through the valleys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woods thinned about them, and they found themselves
in a soft, green glade on the brow of a high hill,
with the sunset shining in on them, and bits of blue forest
visible in the distance. Mellis reined in. She was beginning
to gather the subtle threads of life into her own
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is our camping ground. It will serve us for to-night.
We passed a spring five minutes ago, a spring of
clear water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dismounted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow night we shall be in Gawdy Town, if no
one says us nay.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XL</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant unsaddled and unbridled
the horses while Mellis took the pitcher and
went down to the spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not hurry herself, but walked slowly through
the bracken and under the full shade of the trees, her
eyes looking into the distance as though she were deep
in thought. Once or twice she smiled, and pressed her
hand over her heart. Her face had a soft white radiance,
a mysterious glow beneath the skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spring was the beginning of one of the forest
streams, a brown pool that overflowed and trickled in a
green and oozy dampness down the hillside. The clear
water lay like a mirror, reflecting the branches and the
fragments of blue sky overhead. Mellis knelt down and
gazed at herself in the pool. She was very fair, with dark
and desirous eyes, and she loved herself for Martin’s sake.
Her hair came falling from under her hood, and one
strand touched the water, stirring a faint and transient
ripple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis filled her pitcher and went back to the glade.
The west was a glory of gold, the light smiting the trees
and spreading a yellow glow upon the grass. The distant
forest vistas were all purple, shading into a violet horizon.
Somewhere a blackbird was singing to his mate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw Martin Valliant sitting at the foot of a great
oak, and staring at the sunset. The slanting light touched
his face and made it shine with a strange yet somber fire.
So absorbed was he that he did not see Mellis coming
through the bracken. The two horses were cropping the
grass; saddles, harness, and saddle-bags lay piled under
Martin’s oak tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis caught a deep breath, and laid a hand upon her
bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin—Martin Valliant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was very soft and challenging. Martin turned,
looked at her strangely, and stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dreams!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were full of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet men must live by bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She set the pitcher on the grass, opened the saddle-bags,
and spread their supper on the grass. Martin stood
and watched her, mute, frowning, like a man breathless
from a sudden pain at the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear lad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on calmly with her work, cutting the bread
with a knife she had brought from Marvel’s cottage, and
spreading honey upon the slices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What troubles you, Martin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer for a moment. She knelt, looking
up at him; the obstinate anguish in his eyes betrayed to
her all that was in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, you are tired; you shall eat and sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spread a cloak and made a rest of one of the saddles,
talking the while as though no love-crisis threatened
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what it is to be weary, to feel that death might
take you, and you would not care. Then one falls down
under a haystack and sleeps, and in the morning the sun
is shining, and the world seems young again. Wine and
water, cooked meat, bread and honey and a spiced cake!
Let us be thankful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lay down some two paces from her, propping himself
on one elbow and not using the saddle that she had
fetched to serve as a rest. His eyes avoided hers. Mellis
had spread the slices of meat on a great green dock leaf,
and she held out the dish with both hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eat, and then you shall talk to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a silent meal, but Mellis had her way. She did
not trouble him with words, or by watching him with
questioning eyes. He was like a restive horse, or a thing in
pain, to be soothed and calmed and rescued from its own
restlessness. Her mood seemed as calm and as tranquil as
the brown dusk that was beginning to fill the woods while
the western sky still blazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had ended their meal she knelt up and drew
the linen out of her saddle-bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The light is going. Come here to me, Martin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her almost with fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wounded shoulder must be cared for. You will
carry the mark of it, always, for my sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not move, and she went to him on her knees,
reaching for the pitcher and the wine. He raised a hand
as though to repulse her, but she put it gently aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet all the while that she was busy with his shoulder
he sat with bowed head, silent, brooding, not even wincing
when she cleaned the raw wound, and poured in wine.
His eyes stared at the grass; the only pain he felt was the
mystical anguish that her soft hands caused him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knelt facing him of a sudden, her eyes looking
steadily into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you may speak to me, Martin Valliant. There
can be no silence between us. Tell me all that is in your
heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His head seemed to sink lower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you afraid of me, Martin—you who would fear
no man? What am I but a woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the woman I fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! man—man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered her sullenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was on the way to sin against you. What am I but
an outcast? What can I give you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I ask of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I who must ask for you, think for you, face God
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, look into my eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, what do you see in them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face shone with a strange light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see—something—something that is too good and
great for me, a sacred thing that I must not touch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew her breath deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my man, what has come to you? Will you not
think of me as the woman, the woman to be saved from
other men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was hoarse, and she felt the muscles in his
arms quivering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you cannot shirk that truth. But what is in your
mind? You spoke of Swartz and Gawdy Town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He steadied himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is ended. Is there no right of sanctuary in the
land?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sanctuary?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had begun to tremble a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The nuns of Lilburn Minster are good women; you
could take sanctuary there—till the times mended. No
man could harm you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, you are offering me death!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, man—man! Have we not suffered enough together?
Are you turning to stone? Is it for my sake? I
would rather die than do this thing! My heart will have
none of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed his head over her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I be strong—for your sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strong—to wound me—to the death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let go of his hands, drew aside, and knelt staring at
the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she spoke, and her voice accused him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you but a child, Martin, soul blinded, the fool of
visions? Life cannot go back. Things happen; it is like the
dawn of the day, the birth of a flower. You cannot stay
the sun from rising, or bid the sap not flow in the tree.
And you have made me love you. I have spoken. Would
you put the truth in me to shame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose up, leaving her kneeling there, and his face was
a mist of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the truth. It is in your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood staring at the fading west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, speak to me! Let me listen for a voice. Give me
strength—strength.”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XLI</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>He began to walk up and down the glade as
though he were in the cloisters at Paradise, and
Mellis did not hinder him or try to persuade him
any further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose up, put the food that was left back into the
saddle-bags, and took the horses down to the spring to
drink. When she returned to the glade Martin Valliant
was still walking up and down, his hands gripping the
bosom of his smock. He did not look at her, and his face
had grown gray in the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis fastened the two horses to a tree for the night,
and taking Fulk de Lisle’s sword, she set about gathering
bracken. The western sky was streaked with amber, and
the light was growing dim; yet as Mellis used the sword
a faint glimmer shone from it, like the glimmer of a star.
The bracken was all feathery blackness under the great
trees, falling to the sharp blade as she swung it from right
to left. The sweet, wild scent of the fern was like a plaintive
memory. The sword made hardly a sound as it cut
through the tall stems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin had paused, and was watching her. She showed
as a dim figure in the dusk, with white face and hands.
And even this strange labor of hers seemed part of the
mystery of the Forest and of life, so much so that he felt
enveloped by it, caught in some enchantment. What was
she doing? And why did every act of hers take on a strange
significance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Mellis set the sword in the ground, and gather
up a bosomful of bracken. She came past him as he stood,
and her eyes were dark and inscrutable. She threw the
bracken down under the oak tree, and went back for more.
Then Martin understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shiver of emotion went through him; he found himself
trembling at the knees. What a silence was this about
them! What a falling of the night! What secrecy! What
enchantment! The sunset had died on the hills; nothing
but a faint afterglow remained, and above the trees the
stars were beginning to shine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin moved to and fro, but all his thoughts were with
Mellis, and her gathering of the fern. She had taken the
sword and had cut more bracken. The thick green riding-cloak
that had been strapped behind her saddle served
to carry the stuff; she spread the cloak on the ground, piled
bracken on it, drew the two ends together, and carried the
bundle to the oak tree. Mellis made a dozen such journeys
to and fro, till she had built up a deep bed of the soft
green fronds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin saw her spread her cloak on the bracken and
set Fulk de Lisle’s sword in the ground at the head
thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned away, and as he turned she called to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Martin, are you still thinking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it is all so simple!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard her sigh, and his heart smote him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am lonely. And I still have a fear that in the night
men will break in and take you away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If God wills it, it will be so,” he answered her with
obstinate sententiousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down on the bracken, untied her hair, shook it
free, and began to comb it with a little ivory comb that
she took from her gypsire. It was growing very dark now,
and the stars were bright between the trees. Martin strode
up and down, discovering a new torment in her silence,
and in the darkness that seemed to be taking her from
him. He could see her white hands moving, but her face
was hidden by her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke to her at last, but she did not answer him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin went nearer, trying not to be troubled by her
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A passionate whisper came back to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are breaking my heart. What does it matter? You
shall not hear me humble myself again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slunk away, threw himself flat on the grass, utterly
shaken and distraught. The silence of the Forest seemed
heavy in his ears, for he was listening for some sound from
Mellis, and he could not even hear her breathing. A kind
of fury seized him. He tore up handfuls of grass, pressed
his mouth against the earth. Why was this agony being
thrust upon him? Had he not tried to deal honestly with
his own heart? And he had wounded Mellis, humbled her,
turned away from her love as though it were a poor thing
easily abandoned. She was beginning to hate him; or perhaps
her pride would never forgive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could he say to her? Should he leave her while
she slept? But that would be cowardly; he could not
desert her till she was in the midst of friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat up, staring toward where she was, for he thought
he had heard a rustling of the bracken. But it was so dark
now that he could not see Mellis, only the vague outline
of the great tree with the stars studding the sky over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of a sudden Martin stopped breathing, every fiber of
him tense and strained. It was not the rustling of the
bracken that he had heard. The sound grew louder, less
smothered, as though it was too bitter and poignant to be
stifled. Mellis was weeping—weeping as though the pain
could not be borne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin began to tremble. All his blood seemed to be
rising to his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he uttered a strange, sharp cry, and went blindly
through the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was on his knees beside her. She was lying on her
face, her arms spread out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellis, I can’t bear it. Oh! my love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She twisted around, threw her arms around him, and
cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My man! My most dear!”</p>

<div><h1><span class='it'>Chapter XLII</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A brisk breeze blew from the sea over the marshes
north of Gawdy Town, turning the willows that
grew by the banks of the Rondel a soft gray, and
making a great flutter among the aspen leaves. The reeds
bowed and swayed in the dykes. The purple shadows of
the clouds raced over the marshland meadows where the
red cattle stood knee-deep in the lush grass. Gawdy Town
itself spread its ruddy roofs to the evening sunlight, and
flashed its vanes and flèches against a summer sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Along the road between the dykes came Mellis and
Martin Valliant, trudging it on foot, their horses left
wandering in the Forest. They looked like a country
couple, Mellis in her rough shoes and russet gown, Martin
in Lincoln green, a cudgel on his shoulder, and a
couple of saddle-bags slung from it. He had thrown Fulk
de Lisle’s sword and dagger into the Rondel, for such fine
gear did not suit the cut of his clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis’s face seemed to shine with an inward light, and
when Martin looked at her it was with eyes that said that
she was the most wonderful thing in the wide world. He
marched with a slight swing of the shoulders and a
more adventurous carriage of the head. His manhood had
lost its monkish distemper. Mellis had rescued him, and
made him the lord of his own youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they came to Gawdy Town, just before sunset and
the closing of the gates. Women and children were coming
in from the meadows and gardens without the walls,
carrying baskets of flowers and herbs; there were wenches,
too, who had been out milking, stepping along with pails
of milk hanging from the yoke chains. Old gaffers toddled
along the road, gossiping about swine and the hay crop.
Not a soul had heard a whisper of the battle of Bracknell
Plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis and her man entered the north gate with this
stream of milkmaids, children, gardeners, and farmer folk,
and no one said them nay. The porter had his face buried
in a black jack as they passed, and Mellis laughed and
glimmered her eyes at Martin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow is a good Christian. He sees only that
which God meant him to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bells were ringing in Gawdy Town, bells great and
small, for the people of Gawdy Town loved their bells.
They were a folk, too, who delighted in color, on the
fronts of their houses, in their signs, and in their clothes,
and there was not a richer town in all the south. The great
street between the gates looked as though it had been
garnished for a pageant; the plaster fronts of the houses
were painted in reds and blues and greens and yellows;
many of the barge-boards of the gables were gilded; the
people who filled the streets were a chequer of moving
color, a gay and buxom crowd delighting in scarlets and
bright greens and blues. Women leaned out of the windows
and gossiped across the street, showing off their
stomachers and the sleeves of their gowns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin Valliant had never seen such a sight before. He
shouldered a way for Mellis, trying not to stare at all these
strange people, and at the quaint signs, and the rich stuffs
in the shops. Some one blundered against his wounded
shoulder, and he was not so meek over it as he would have
been a month ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they holding a fair in Gawdy Town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis glanced at him mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent a herald forward, dear lad, and they are looking
for us. This is but an ant-heap after all. Some day I will
show you Rouen and Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quieter street would please me. Where is this Inn
of the ‘Crossed Keys’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, down by the harbor. This way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned aside into a dark and narrow lane, where
the gables of the houses nearly met overhead. Lines festooned
the alley, carrying all manner of garments hung
out to dry. It was a lane of slatterns, and of dirty children
playing in the gutters, and the smell of it was not sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How does this please my lord?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would sooner sleep in the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew close in under his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so say I. A clean attic at the ‘Crossed Keys’ will
serve. Pray God old Swartz is there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lane led them down toward the harbor, where the
painted masts and tops of the ships showed above the
town wall. Here were the shops of the ships’ chandlers,
and the place began to smell of tar and the sea. There
were yards full of timber, spars, anchors, casks, old iron,
chains, oars, gratings, lanterns, and pumps. A rope-walk
ran along the town wall, with pent-roofs for the storage of
cables. The taverns and inns were for the men of the
sea, boisterous houses full of strong liquor and loose
women and foreign ship-men who were handy with their
knives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Inn of the “Crossed Keys” lay a little way from
the harbor and next to “Little Spain.” It was a solid and
orderly inn, and no “stew” house; men of substance and
many merchants lodged there in their comings and goings,
and for the ordering of their affairs. No man had ever been
found stabbed in the “Crossed Keys,” nor had a robbery
ever been committed there within the memory of any living
gossip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk was falling when Martin walked into the inn yard
and asked for the master. An old fellow with white hair
and a lame leg came out of the parlor, buttoned up in a
sober black cloak, and with a black velvet cap on his head.
He looked more like an Oxford clerk than an innkeeper,
but his eyes were shrewd enough in his smooth, debonair
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mellis was waiting in the shadow of the stairway leading
to the gallery around the yard. The old man’s eyes did
not fail to see her. He looked straight at Martin as though
he had weighed him from shoe-latchet to cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next door, my lad. ‘Little Spain’ is the place for you,
I gather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin knew nothing of “Little Spain,” and his soul
took no offense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the ‘Crossed Keys’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been called that these fifty years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there a Peter Swartz in the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man blinked his bright eyes, glanced right and
left, and poked his nose into Martin’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of the name of Valliant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Valliant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tsst! Not so loud! I am at your service. Come this way,
Master Valliant, and you, madam. Up the stairway; yes—yes—the
gentleman is here; to the right, if you please, and
down that passage. Let me pass, sir; I know the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room into which he showed them was a private
chamber, hung with green arras and lit by a couple of
candles set in tall pewter sticks on the oak table. A man
sat at supper, with a meat pasty, a jug of wine, bread,
cheese, and fresh fruit heaped up in a bowl before him.
He was making himself a salad of herbs when the door
opened and the old man poked his head into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Master Valliant, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz threw the wooden spoon and fork on the table
and stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye gods, this is magnificent!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man closed the door on Mellis and Martin Valliant,
and they stood before Peter Swartz like a couple of
shy children. Then Martin’s arm crept over Mellis’s shoulders.
She was red as a rose, but her eyes looked proudly at
Peter Swartz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That most magnanimous soldier of fortune scanned the
faces of the pair before him, smiled, gave a wag of the
head, and filled a glass with wine. He bowed to Mellis,
raised the glass, and drank to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam, I pledge you my homage. I am, and shall
always be, your devoted servant. As for this fellow——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped up to Martin, smiling, and gave him a blow
on the chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a man who has learned the greater wisdom.
Good comrade, shake hands with me; the whole world is
ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz went to the door, and shouted for the old
gentleman in the black gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine host, mine ancient and most sweet angel, more
wine here, and platters, and more light.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wine came, also two more candles, and a rush-seated
chair for Mellis. Swartz was in a joyous mood, and
the shy yet exultant faces of these two young people filled
him with an amused delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come—sit you down. The place of honor for Madam
Mellis. Russet and green, two good colors; friend Martin
there has been fighting, a sword-thrust through the shoulder—eh?
Take off your cap, man; there are no spies here.
And now for the news; I’ll tell mine afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mellis who told the tale of their adventures as
far as the slaying of Fulk de Lisle, Martin watching her
with a rapt look, and forgetting that there was food on his
plate. She had nothing to say of the journey to Gawdy
Town, but Swartz had but to look at their faces to know
that Martin had played the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the old Fox of Troy was too cunning for your
friends. Well, well—what is it to be—France and the open
road, service with some fine Frenchman or a rich Italian,
and our friend Martin here becoming a great captain with
a helmet full of gold pieces? This wet island has wearied
me. I can show you sunny lands and a world of adventure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martin’s eyes watched Mellis’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am but a beggar,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him dearly, and then at Swartz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have twenty gold pieces, Martin and I. I carried
them about with me, and hid them while we were at
Woodmere. They are here—in a leather purse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shrewd wench—and great lady! Martin, my man, you
may do the fighting, but you should leave all else to your
wife. She will be wiser than any Lombard. Well, old
Swartz can put his hand on fifty gold pieces, and I brought
a little plunder away with me that night I left the island.
These English drink too much, and some one must have
missed a suit of harness and a couple of horses. Old Master
Hilary here has bought the horses, and Martin can
have the harness. Why, we are ripe and ready for sword-hire,
and there is a ship sailing to-morrow for France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned over and filled the drinking cups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s to our good fortune, and the Knave of Hearts.
Give me the gay, vagabond, generous, fighting life. Here’s
to you, madam, and here’s to Martin Valliant, and here’s
to old Peter Swartz! Martin, my lad, I’ll make you the
finest sworder and swashbuckler this side of Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grew quiet when he had had his jest with them,
and it was Mellis who spoke for Martin and herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The life will be rough, but I do not fear it. My man
will guard me, and I shall be his mate. What are riches,
and acres—and a lordly house? The sun and the green
earth are for all, and youth goes where it pleases. Let the
old folk count their cattle, and warm their hands at the
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at Martin, and he nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do good deeds—with the sword,” he said; “let
us go out into the world and see the great cities. A man
was given eyes to see with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swartz raised his cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a heart—to love with! Oh, brave youth, never to
grow old in the same bed, and to cross the same dull doorstep
day by day! Here’s to the wander life—here’s to adventure!
Assuredly I must get me a wife, and there shall
be four of us. Peter Swartz is young again; God be
praised!”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
